# Plan My Day

Generate a clean, actionable hour-by-hour plan for the day based on priorities, energy patterns, and constraints.

## Mode

Detect from context or ask: *"Quick priorities, full day plan, or full plan + weekly structure?"*

| Mode | What you get | Best for |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `quick` | Top 3 priorities + rough time blocks, 2 min | Morning sprint, already know the day |
| `standard` | Full hour-by-hour energy-optimized plan | Default daily planning |
| `deep` | Full plan + energy pattern analysis + weekly structure recommendations | Overhauling your schedule, high-performance week |

**Default: `standard`** — use `quick` if they say "just help me prioritize." Use `deep` if they want to rethink their week, not just plan today.

## Why This vs ChatGPT?

**Problem with "just asking":** You get a different plan each time. No consistency, no memory of what works, no optimization over time.

**This skill provides:**
1. **Consistent methodology** - Same decision framework every day (Top 3 priorities, energy windows, buffer rules)
2. **Energy-aware scheduling** - Automatically matches high-cognitive tasks to your peak hours
3. **Constraint-aware** - Respects your existing calendar, energy patterns, personal boundaries
4. **Learning memory** - Can track what scheduling patterns work best for you over time
5. **Evening reflection built-in** - Forces accountability on what actually got done

**You can replicate this** by writing the same detailed prompt every day, manually checking your calendar, remembering your energy patterns, and tracking completion rates. Or use this skill in 2 minutes.

## Usage

```
/plan-my-day [optional: YYYY-MM-DD for future date]
```

With custom energy profile:

```
/plan-my-day --peak 9-11,14-16 --recovery 13-14
```

## Planning Principles (Research-Backed)

1. **Circadian optimization** - Cognitive performance peaks ~2-3 hours after waking (Roenneberg, 2012)
2. **Ultradian rhythms** - Work in 90-minute blocks with 15-20 minute breaks (Ericsson, 1993)
3. **Decision fatigue prevention** - Schedule high-stakes decisions before 3pm (Kahneman, 2011)
4. **Implementation intentions** - Specific time+task combinations increase completion by 2-3× (Gollwitzer, 1999)

## Energy Windows (Default - Customize Yours)

**Peak Performance (Morning):** 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- Deep work, strategic thinking, complex problem-solving
- Highest cognitive capacity
- Schedule your #1 priority here

**Secondary Peak (Afternoon):** 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM
- Focused work, meetings with decisions, creative work
- Still high capacity but slightly lower than morning

**Administrative (Late Afternoon):** 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM
- Email processing, light tasks, 1-on-1s, planning
- Lower energy, avoid complex decisions

**Recovery Blocks:** 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM, 6:00 PM+
- Meals, exercise, walks, recharge
- Non-negotiable for sustained performance

**Wind Down (Evening):** After 7:00 PM
- Reflection, reading, light planning for tomorrow
- No high-cognitive work

## Process

### 1. Gather Context (30 seconds)
- Check existing calendar events
- Review yesterday's incomplete tasks
- Identify any fixed commitments or deadlines
- Note current project priorities

### 2. Identify Top 3 Priorities (60 seconds)
Ask for each potential priority:
- **Impact:** Does this move a key metric or deadline?
- **Urgency:** Must it happen today?
- **Effort:** Can I complete it in available time?

**Filter:** Pick the 3 with highest impact×urgency score

### 3. Build Time-Blocked Schedule (90 seconds)
**Sequencing logic:**
1. Place fixed commitments (meetings, calls) first
2. Assign Priority #1 to longest peak energy block
3. Assign Priority #2 to secondary peak or next available
4. Assign Priority #3 to remaining focused time
5. Add 20-minute buffers between major blocks
6. Schedule admin work (email, Slack) in low-energy windows
7. Protect breaks and meals (non-negotiable)

**Buffer rule:** Only schedule 80% of available time

### 4. Apply Constraints
- **Personal boundaries:** No work before 8am or after 7pm (customize)
- **Meeting limits:** Max 4 hours of meetings per day
- **Focus blocks:** Minimum 90 minutes for deep work (no interruptions)
- **Break enforcement:** 15-minute break every 90 minutes

## Quick Decision Framework

**Before saying YES to anything today:**

1. **Is this one of my top 3 priorities?**
   - YES → Schedule it in appropriate energy window
   - NO → Go to #2

2. **Does this directly support today's mission?**
   - YES → Add to relevant time block
   - NO → Go to #3

3. **Can this wait until tomorrow?**
   - YES → Add to tomorrow's list
   - NO → Question if it's really urgent

**If NO to all three → Decline or defer**

## Real Examples

### Example 1: High-Output Day (Founder/Exec)

**Context:** Product launch week, high-stakes demos, team coordination

```markdown
## Top 3 Priorities:
1. Finalize launch announcement (900 words, 3 versions) - DONE by 11:30

## Evening Check-In:
✓ Priority 1: YES (shipped 3 versions, CEO approved)
✓ Priority 2: YES (partner committed, contract signed)
✓ Priority 3: YES (team aligned, stories pointed)

What worked: Protected deep work time for writing, prepped demo thoroughly
Tomorrow: Start execution on sprint, less coordination overhead
```

### Example 2: Deep Work Day (Individual Contributor)

What worked: Zero meetings = maximum flow state
Tomorrow: Finish docs, start new feature work
```

### Example 3: Meeting-Heavy Day (Manager/Director)

**Context:** Leadership role, multiple teams, coordination day

```markdown
## Top 3 Priorities:
1. Align exec team on Q2 budget priorities - DONE by 11:00

✓ Priority 2: YES (performance plan agreed, follow-up scheduled)
✓ Priority 3: YES (2 approved, 1 needs revision)

What got stuck: Back-to-back meetings = no thinking time
Tomorrow: Block 2-hour deep work window, fewer meetings
```

## Real Case Study

**User:** Marketing manager at B2B SaaS company, struggled with reactive days

**Before using skill:**
- Average day: 6-8 hours in meetings, 2 hours of "work" squeezed in
- Top priorities rarely completed
- Constant email/Slack interruptions
- 15% weekly goal completion rate
- Felt productive but accomplished little

**After implementing plan-my-day:**
- Used skill every morning (2-3 minutes to generate plan)
- Protected 9-11am deep work block (calendar marked "Focus Time")
- Set clear Top 3 priorities each day
- Added evening check-ins to track completion

**Results after 8 weeks:**
- 74% weekly goal completion rate (+59 points)
- Meetings reduced from 6-8 hrs/day to 3-4 hrs/day
- Deep work blocks protected 4 days/week (vs 0 before)
- Self-reported energy levels: 8.2/10 (vs 4.1/10 before)
- Team feedback: "You're more present and decisive"

**Key insight:** "The daily plan gave me permission to say no. If it wasn't in my Top 3, I deferred it. That one change unlocked everything."

## Configuration Options

**No dependencies required** - Pure planning logic.

## Future Integrations (Coming Soon)

- **Google Calendar sync** - Auto-import existing events
- **Completion tracking** - Analytics on your planning accuracy over time
- **Energy pattern learning** - Adapts to when you actually perform best
- **Team coordination** - Sync focus blocks across teams

## Pro Tips

1. **Run it FIRST thing** - Before checking email or Slack. Set the day, don't react to it.
2. **Protect Peak hours** - Block 9-11am as "Focus Time" on your calendar. Decline meetings here.
3. **Track completion rates** - Use evening check-in data to improve your estimations
4. **Adjust energy windows** - Default is 9-11am peak, but if you're different, customize it
5. **Combine with "shutdown ritual"** - Evening check-in + tomorrow's prep = mental closure
6. **Don't over-schedule** - If plan shows 7 hours of tasks for 8-hour day, you're on track

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Planning too much** - If you schedule 100% of your time, you'll fail. Always leave 20% buffer.
❌ **Ignoring energy windows** - Putting hard thinking work at 4pm sets you up for failure.
❌ **Skipping breaks** - 90-minute focus blocks REQUIRE 15-minute breaks or performance drops.
❌ **No evening reflection** - Without check-ins, you can't improve your planning accuracy.
❌ **Changing Top 3 mid-day** - Unless genuinely urgent, stick to morning priorities.

## Quality Checklist

A good daily plan has:
- [ ] Clear Top 3 priorities with measurable outcomes
- [ ] #1 priority scheduled in peak energy window
- [ ] 20% buffer time (not every minute scheduled)
- [ ] Breaks scheduled every 90 minutes
- [ ] Protected lunch break (minimum 30 minutes)
- [ ] Evening check-in template included
- [ ] No work scheduled after 7pm (personal time protected)

## Support

Issues or suggestions? Provide:
- Your typical day structure (work hours, meeting load)
