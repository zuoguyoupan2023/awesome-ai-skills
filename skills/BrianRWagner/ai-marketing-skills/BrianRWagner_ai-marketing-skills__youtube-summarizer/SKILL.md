# YouTube Summarizer Skill

Automatically fetch transcripts from YouTube videos, generate structured summaries, and deliver full transcripts to messaging platforms.

## Mode

Detect from context or ask: *"Quick TL;DR, full summary, or full summary with content angles?"*

| Mode | What you get | Best for |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `quick` | 3-bullet TL;DR + single key takeaway | Fast consumption, sharing a clip |
| `standard` | Full structured summary: thesis, insights, takeaway | Learning, note-taking, research |
| `deep` | Full summary + chapter breakdown + content repurposing opportunities | Turning a video into a content asset |

**Default: `standard`** — use `quick` if they just want the gist. Use `deep` if they want to extract the video into usable content.

## Why This vs ChatGPT?

**Problem with ChatGPT:** It can't access YouTube transcripts directly. You have to manually copy/paste captions or use a third-party tool first, then feed the text to ChatGPT. Multi-step, clunky, loses video metadata.

**This skill provides:**
1. **One-step transcript extraction** - Drop a YouTube URL, get the full transcript automatically
2. **Structured summarization** - Consistent format (thesis → insights → takeaway) every time, not random bullet points
3. **Video metadata included** - Title, channel, views, publish date embedded in summary
4. **Full transcript delivery** - Saves timestamped transcript to file and sends to Telegram/chat platforms
5. **Works from VPS/cloud** - Uses Android client emulation to bypass YouTube's cloud IP blocking (where yt-dlp fails)
6. **Multi-language support** - Auto-fetches in requested language with English fallback

**You can replicate this** by manually enabling captions, copying text, pasting to ChatGPT, reformatting the output, saving to a file, and uploading. Takes 5-10 minutes. This skill does it in 15-20 seconds.

## When to Use

Activate this skill when:
- User shares a YouTube URL (youtube.com/watch, youtu.be, youtube.com/shorts)
- User asks to summarize or transcribe a YouTube video
- User requests information about a YouTube video's content
- You need to analyze video content for research or content creation

## Dependencies

**Required:** MCP YouTube Transcript server must be installed at:
`/root/clawd/mcp-server-youtube-transcript`

If not present, install it:
```bash
cd /root/clawd
git clone https://github.com/kimtaeyoon83/mcp-server-youtube-transcript.git
cd mcp-server-youtube-transcript
npm install && npm run build
```

## Workflow

### 1. Detect YouTube URL
Extract video ID from these patterns:
- `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`
- `https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID`
- `https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VIDEO_ID`
- Direct video ID: `VIDEO_ID` (11 characters)

### 2. Fetch Transcript
Run this command to get the transcript:
```bash
cd /root/clawd/mcp-server-youtube-transcript && node --input-type=module -e "
import { getSubtitles } from './dist/youtube-fetcher.js';
const result = await getSubtitles({ videoID: 'VIDEO_ID', lang: 'en' });
console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
" > /tmp/yt-transcript.json
```

Replace `VIDEO_ID` with the extracted ID. Read the output from `/tmp/yt-transcript.json`.

### 3. Process the Data

Parse the JSON to extract:
- `result.metadata.title` - Video title
- `result.metadata.author` - Channel name
- `result.metadata.viewCount` - Formatted view count
- `result.metadata.publishDate` - Publication date
- `result.actualLang` - Language used
- `result.lines` - Array of transcript segments

Full text: `result.lines.map(l => l.text).join(' ')`

### 4. Generate Summary

Create a structured summary using this template:

```markdown
📹 **Video:** [title]
👤 **Channel:** [author] | 👁️ **Views:** [views] | 📅 **Published:** [date]

**🎯 Main Thesis:**
[1-2 sentence core argument/message]

**💡 Key Insights:**
- [insight 1]
- [insight 2]
- [insight 3]
- [insight 4]
- [insight 5]

**📝 Notable Points:**
- [additional point 1]
- [additional point 2]

**🔑 Takeaway:**
[Practical application or conclusion]
```

Aim for:
- Main thesis: 1-2 sentences maximum
- Key insights: 3-5 bullets, each 1-2 sentences
- Notable points: 2-4 supporting details
- Takeaway: Actionable conclusion

### 5. Save Full Transcript

Save the complete transcript to a timestamped file:
```
/root/clawd/transcripts/YYYY-MM-DD_VIDEO_ID.txt
```

Include in the file:
- Video metadata header (title, channel, URL, date)
- Full transcript text
- URL reference for easy lookup

### 6. Platform-Specific Delivery

**If channel is Telegram:**
```bash
message --action send --channel telegram --target CHAT_ID \
  --filePath /root/clawd/transcripts/YYYY-MM-DD_VIDEO_ID.txt \
  --caption "📄 YouTube Transcript: [title]"
```

**If channel is other/webchat:**
Just reply with the summary (no file attachment).

### 7. Reply with Summary

Send the structured summary as your response to the user.

## Examples

### Example 1: Tech Tutorial

**Input:** `https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`

**Output:**
```markdown
📹 **Video:** "Building a SaaS from Scratch: Lessons from $10K MRR"
👤 **Channel:** IndieHackerTV | 👁️ **Views:** 124K | 📅 **Published:** Feb 1, 2026

**🎯 Main Thesis:**
Most SaaS founders fail because they build for 6 months before talking to customers. The path to $10K MRR is customer conversations first, MVP second.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- Interviewed 50 potential customers before writing a single line of code
- First paid customer signed up with a Figma mockup (no product built yet)
- Charged $99/month from day 1 (no free tier, no discounts)
- Spent $0 on ads; all growth from Twitter + Reddit engagement
- Hit $10K MRR in 9 months by saying "no" to feature requests that didn't fit ICP

**📝 Notable Points:**
- Used Stripe payment links before building a billing system
- First 3 customers came from solving their problem in public on Twitter
- Weekly "build in public" updates on Twitter drove 40% of signups

**🔑 Takeaway:**
Validate demand before building. If 10 people won't pay for a mockup, 1,000 won't pay for the real product.
```

### Example 2: Business Strategy Video

**Input:** `https://youtu.be/abc123xyz`

**Output:**
```markdown
📹 **Video:** "Why Notion's Business Model is Genius"
👤 **Channel:** SaaS Breakdowns | 👁️ **Views:** 456K | 📅 **Published:** Jan 28, 2026

**🎯 Main Thesis:**
Notion's growth strategy flips traditional SaaS: give away the product for free to individuals, monetize when they bring it to work.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- 80% of Notion's enterprise deals started with a single employee using the free plan
- Bottom-up adoption = zero sales team needed for first $10M ARR
- Templates marketplace created a content flywheel (100K+ free templates)
- Personal use (free) → Team use (paid) conversion rate: 23% (industry avg: 2-5%)
- Community evangelism replaced traditional marketing (4M+ Reddit/Discord members)

**📝 Notable Points:**
- Notion's viral coefficient: 1.4 (every user invites 1.4 others on average)
- Template creators drive 30% of new user acquisition
- Pricing strategy: free until 10 people = no friction to start

**🔑 Takeaway:**
Build a product individuals love first. Enterprise sales will follow when employees demand it at work.
```

## Quality Guidelines

- **Be concise:** Summary should be scannable in 30 seconds
- **Be accurate:** Don't add information not in the transcript
- **Be structured:** Use consistent formatting for easy reading
- **Be contextual:** Adjust detail level based on video length
  - Short videos (<5 min): Brief summary (3 key insights)
  - Medium videos (5-30 min): Standard format (5 key insights)
  - Long videos (>30 min): Detailed breakdown (7+ insights, split into sections if needed)
- **Extract value:** Focus on actionable insights, data points, and contrarian takes (not generic advice)

## Pro Tips

**For Better Summaries:**
1. **Prioritize data points** - Numbers, percentages, study citations stand out
2. **Extract quotes** - Memorable one-liners make summaries shareable
3. **Identify frameworks** - If video presents a method/process, extract the steps
4. **Spot contrarian takes** - Unconventional wisdom is more valuable than common advice
5. **Note proof** - Examples, case studies, before/after results add credibility

**For Research Workflows:**
1. **Build a transcript library** - Organize by topic/niche for pattern spotting
2. **Search across transcripts** - Use `grep` or text search to find mentions of specific topics
3. **Track trends** - Same topic across multiple videos = rising trend
4. **Extract prompts** - Save useful frameworks/methods as reusable prompts

**For Content Creation:**
1. **Find content gaps** - What questions are asked but not fully answered?
2. **Analyze top performers** - What structure/pacing do high-view videos use?
3. **Extract hooks** - First 30 seconds of transcript = proven hook patterns
4. **Repurpose insights** - Turn video insights into Twitter threads, blog posts, newsletters
