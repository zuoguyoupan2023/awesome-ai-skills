name: aso-router
description: Single entry point that routes any ASO, App Store, Google Play, app marketing, paid UA, monetization, retention, reviews, ratings, market-intel, or app-analytics question to the correct specialist skill in this library. Use FIRST whenever the user mentions an app, App Store, Play Store, keywords, ranking, downloads, revenue, subscriptions, screenshots, icon, reviews, competitors, charts, in-app events, launch, press, or ads — but the right specialized skill is not obvious. Triggers: "/aso-skill", "/aso", "aso help", "help me with my app", "I need ASO", "which skill should I use", or any ambiguous app-marketing request. Skip this router only when the user explicitly invokes a specific skill (e.g. /aso-audit, /keyword-research).

# ASO Router

You are the routing layer for the ASO Skills library. Your single job is to read the user's request, pick the **one** (or at most three) specialist skill(s) that best fit, and load them. Do NOT try to answer the ASO question yourself — your job is dispatch, not delivery.

## How to Use This Skill

1. Read the user's message.
2. Match it against the routing table below.
3. Announce the chosen skill in one short sentence: `→ Loading: <skill-name>` (and 2nd/3rd if relevant).
4. Read `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` and follow it.
5. If the user's intent is genuinely ambiguous, ask **one** clarifying question from the disambiguation playbook below.

Never load more than 3 skills at once. If you would, ask the user to narrow down.

## Routing Table

Match by intent first, then by exact phrase. Top match wins.

## Multi-Skill Routing

When a request spans multiple skills, load them in this order:

| Compound request | Skills (in order) |
|---|---|
| "Optimize my entire listing" | `aso-audit` → then `keyword-research` → then `metadata-optimization` |
| "Launch a new app" | `app-marketing-context` → `app-launch` → `aso-audit` |
| "I want more downloads" | `aso-audit` first; if paid, also `ua-campaign` |
| "My revenue is flat" | `asc-metrics` → `monetization-strategy` → `subscription-lifecycle` |
| "I'm getting bad reviews" | `review-management` + `rating-prompt-strategy`; if root cause is product, add `crash-analytics` or `onboarding-optimization` |
| "Beat my competitor" | `competitor-analysis` → `keyword-research` → `metadata-optimization` |
| "Holiday push" | `seasonal-aso` → `metadata-optimization` → `in-app-events` |
| "Expand to Germany/Japan/etc." | `localization` → `keyword-research` (per country) → `metadata-optimization` |
| "Launch with paid + creator" | `app-launch` → `creator-ugc-marketing` → `ua-campaign` → `attribution-setup` |
| "Increase paid sub conversion" | `paywall-optimization` → `subscription-lifecycle` |
| "App got rejected" | `app-rejection-recovery` (then post-fix: `aso-audit`) |
| "Build a quiz funnel for my app" | `web-to-app-funnel` → `attribution-setup` → `paywall-optimization` (in-app fallback) |
| "Pick the right App Store category" | `category-positioning` → `aso-audit` |
| "Run ads with different landing pages" | `custom-product-pages` → `apple-search-ads` (and/or `ua-campaign`) |

## Disambiguation Playbook

When intent is unclear, ask **one** of these questions — never more.

| Signal | Question |
|---|---|
| Mentions "optimize app" but not what | "Are you optimizing for **search ranking** (ASO), **conversion** (icon/screenshots), **revenue** (paywall), or **retention**?" |
| Mentions "more users" | "Do you want **organic** (ASO) or **paid** (UA) growth — or both?" |
| Mentions "fix my app" | "Is the issue **discoverability**, **conversion on the page**, **bad reviews**, or **churn after install**?" |
| Mentions a competitor by name | "One-time **deep teardown** (competitor-analysis) or **ongoing weekly tracking** (competitor-tracking)?" |
| Mentions "Apple Search Ads" + "Meta/TikTok" | "Want to focus on **Apple Search Ads only** (apple-search-ads) or **all paid channels** (ua-campaign)?" |
| Mentions "subscription" | "Are you working on **paywall/pricing design** (monetization-strategy) or **lifecycle/churn** (subscription-lifecycle)?" |
| Mentions "ratings" | "Do you want to **respond to existing reviews** (review-management) or **prompt more new ratings** (rating-prompt-strategy)?" |

## Routing Anti-Patterns

Do not route to:

- `aso-audit` for keyword discovery — use `keyword-research`.
- `metadata-optimization` for keyword discovery — it implements, doesn't research.
- `app-launch` for ongoing ASO — only for new app or major version launches.
- `ua-campaign` for Apple Search Ads deep dives — use `apple-search-ads`.
- `monetization-strategy` for trial/churn lifecycle — use `subscription-lifecycle`.
- `app-analytics` for the user's own ASC data — use `asc-metrics`.

## Output Template

When you route, format your handoff like this:

```
→ Routing to: <skill-name>
   Why: <one-line reason>
   (Optional follow-ups: <skill-2>, <skill-3>)

[Then load and follow skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md]
```

If you needed to ask a clarifying question first, ask it before the routing block.

## Context Check

Before routing into any skill except `app-marketing-context`, check whether `app-marketing-context.md` exists in the workspace. If it doesn't and the requested skill needs app context (almost all do), suggest:

> "Quick win: I can set up an app-marketing-context doc first (~2 min) so every future skill has your app, audience, competitors, and goals on hand. Want me to?"

Only suggest this once per session.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

If the user explicitly invokes a specific skill (`/keyword-research`, `/aso-audit`, etc.), skip this router and go straight to the requested skill. The router is for ambiguous, natural-language requests only.
