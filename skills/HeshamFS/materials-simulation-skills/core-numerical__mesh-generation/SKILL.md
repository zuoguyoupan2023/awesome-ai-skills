  Plan and evaluate mesh generation for numerical simulations — estimate grid
  resolution from physics scales (interface width, boundary layers, wavelengths),
  check aspect ratios and skewness against quality thresholds, choose between
  structured, unstructured, and adaptive mesh refinement strategies, and compute
  grid sizing for 1D/2D/3D domains. Use when setting up a new mesh, diagnosing
  poor solver convergence caused by mesh quality, deciding how many points to
  place across a phase-field interface or boundary layer, or preparing a mesh
  convergence study, even if the user only asks "what resolution do I need"
  or "why is my solver failing."

# Mesh Generation

## Goal

Provide a consistent workflow for selecting mesh resolution and checking mesh quality for PDE simulations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- No external dependencies (uses stdlib)

## Inputs to Gather

| Input | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Domain size | Physical dimensions | `1.0 × 1.0 m` |
| Feature size | Smallest feature to resolve | `0.01 m` |
| Points per feature | Resolution requirement | `10 points` |
| Aspect ratio limit | Maximum dx/dy ratio | `5:1` |
| Quality threshold | Skewness limit | `< 0.8` |

## Decision Guidance

### Resolution Selection

```
What is the smallest feature size?
├── Interface width → dx ≤ width / 5
├── Boundary layer → dx ≤ layer_thickness / 10
├── Wave length → dx ≤ lambda / 20
└── Diffusion length → dx ≤ sqrt(D × dt) / 2
```

### Mesh Type Selection

| Problem | Recommended Mesh |
|---------|------------------|
| Simple geometry, uniform | Structured Cartesian |
| Complex geometry | Unstructured triangular/tetrahedral |
| Boundary layers | Hybrid (structured near walls) |
| Adaptive refinement | Quadtree/Octree or AMR |

## Script Outputs (JSON Fields)

| Script | Key Outputs |
|--------|-------------|
| `scripts/grid_sizing.py` | `dx`, `nx`, `ny`, `nz`, `notes` |
| `scripts/mesh_quality.py` | `aspect_ratio`, `skewness`, `quality_flags` |

## Workflow

1. **Estimate resolution** - From physics scales
2. **Compute grid sizing** - Run `scripts/grid_sizing.py`
3. **Check quality metrics** - Run `scripts/mesh_quality.py`
4. **Adjust if needed** - Fix aspect ratios, reduce skewness
5. **Validate** - Mesh convergence study

## Conversational Workflow Example

**User**: I need to mesh a 1mm × 1mm domain for a phase-field simulation with interface width of 10 μm.

**Agent workflow**:
1. Compute grid sizing:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/grid_sizing.py --length 0.001 --resolution 200 --json
   ```
2. Verify interface is resolved: dx = 5 μm, interface width = 10 μm → 2 points per interface width.
3. Recommend: Increase to 500 points (dx = 2 μm) for 5 points across interface.

## Pre-Mesh Checklist

- [ ] Define target resolution per feature/interface
- [ ] Ensure dx meets stability constraints (see numerical-stability)
- [ ] Check aspect ratio < limit (typically 5:1)
- [ ] Check skewness < threshold (typically 0.8)
- [ ] Validate mesh convergence with refinement study

## CLI Examples

```bash
# Compute grid sizing for 1D domain
python3 scripts/grid_sizing.py --length 1.0 --resolution 200 --json

# Check mesh quality
python3 scripts/mesh_quality.py --dx 1.0 --dy 0.5 --dz 0.5 --json

# High aspect ratio check
python3 scripts/mesh_quality.py --dx 1.0 --dy 0.1 --json
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| `length must be positive` | Invalid domain size | Use positive value |
| `resolution must be > 1` | Insufficient points | Use at least 2 |
| `dx, dy must be positive` | Invalid spacing | Use positive values |

## Interpretation Guidance

### Aspect Ratio

| Aspect Ratio | Quality | Impact |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| 1:1 | Excellent | Optimal accuracy |
| 1:1 - 3:1 | Good | Acceptable |
| 3:1 - 5:1 | Fair | May affect accuracy |
| > 5:1 | Poor | Solver issues likely |

### Skewness

| Skewness | Quality | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| 0 - 0.25 | Excellent | Optimal |
| 0.25 - 0.50 | Good | Acceptable |
| 0.50 - 0.80 | Fair | May affect accuracy |
| > 0.80 | Poor | Likely problems |

### Resolution Guidelines

| Application | Points per Feature |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Phase-field interface | 5-10 |
| Boundary layer | 10-20 |
| Shock | 3-5 (with capturing) |
| Wave propagation | 10-20 per wavelength |
| Smooth gradients | 5-10 |

## Security

### Input Validation
- All inputs (`length`, `resolution`, `dx`, `dy`, `dz`) are validated as finite positive numbers with upper bounds to prevent resource exhaustion
- `dims` is restricted to `{1, 2, 3}`
- `argparse` type parameters reject non-numeric input at the CLI boundary before any processing occurs

### File Access
- Scripts read no external files; all inputs are provided via CLI arguments
- Scripts write only to stdout (JSON output); no files are created unless the agent explicitly uses the Write tool

### Tool Restrictions
- **Read**: Used to inspect script source, references, and user configuration files
- **Write**: Used to save grid sizing results or mesh quality reports; writes are scoped to the user's working directory
- **Grep/Glob**: Used to locate relevant files and search references
- The skill's `allowed-tools` excludes `Bash` to prevent the agent from executing arbitrary commands when processing user-provided inputs

### Safety Measures
- No `eval()`, `exec()`, or dynamic code generation
- All subprocess calls use explicit argument lists (no `shell=True`)
- Reduced tool surface (no Bash) means the agent should use `Read` and `Write` to prepare inputs and capture outputs rather than constructing shell commands from user text
- All output is deterministic JSON with no shell-interpretable content

## Limitations

- **2D/3D only**: No unstructured mesh generation
- **Quality metrics**: Basic aspect ratio and skewness only
- **No mesh generation**: Sizing recommendations only
