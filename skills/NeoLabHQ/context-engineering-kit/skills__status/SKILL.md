# Status Check

Display the current state of the FPF knowledge base.

## Action (Run-Time)

1. **Check Directory Structure:** Verify `.fpf/` exists and contains required subdirectories.
2. **Count Hypotheses:** List files in each knowledge layer:
    - `.fpf/knowledge/L0/` (Proposed)
    - `.fpf/knowledge/L1/` (Verified)
    - `.fpf/knowledge/L2/` (Validated)
    - `.fpf/knowledge/invalid/` (Rejected)
3. **Check Evidence Freshness:** Scan `.fpf/evidence/` for expired evidence.
4. **Count Decisions:** List files in `.fpf/decisions/`.
5. **Report to user.**

## Status Report Format

```markdown
## FPF Status

### Directory Structure
- [x] .fpf/ exists
- [x] knowledge/L0/ exists
- [x] knowledge/L1/ exists
- [x] knowledge/L2/ exists
- [x] evidence/ exists
- [x] decisions/ exists

### Current Phase
Based on hypothesis distribution: ABDUCTION | DEDUCTION | INDUCTION | DECISION | IDLE

### Hypothesis Counts

| Layer | Count | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| L0 (Proposed) | 3 | Awaiting verification |
| L1 (Verified) | 2 | Awaiting validation |
| L2 (Validated) | 1 | Ready for decision |
| Invalid | 1 | Rejected |

### Evidence Status

| Total | Fresh | Stale | Expired |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| 5 | 3 | 1 | 1 |

### Warnings

- 1 evidence file is EXPIRED: ev-benchmark-old-2024-06-15
- Consider running `/fpf:decay` to review stale evidence

### Recent Decisions

| DRR | Date | Winner |
|-----|------|--------|
| DRR-2025-01-15-use-redis | 2025-01-15 | redis-caching |
```

## Phase Detection Logic

Determine current phase by examining the knowledge base state:

| Condition | Phase | Next Step |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| No `.fpf/` directory | NOT INITIALIZED | Run `/fpf:propose-hypotheses` |
| L0 > 0, L1 = 0, L2 = 0 | ABDUCTION | Continue with verification |
| L1 > 0, L2 = 0 | DEDUCTION | Continue with validation |
| L2 > 0, no recent DRR | INDUCTION | Continue with audit and decision |
| Recent DRR exists | DECISION COMPLETE | Review decision |
| All empty | IDLE | Run `/fpf:propose-hypotheses` |

## Evidence Freshness Check

For each evidence file in `.fpf/evidence/`:
1. Read the `valid_until` field from frontmatter
2. Compare with current date
3. Classify:
   - **Fresh**: `valid_until` > today + 30 days
   - **Stale**: `valid_until` > today but < today + 30 days
   - **Expired**: `valid_until` < today

If any evidence is stale or expired, warn the user and suggest `/fpf:decay`.

## Example Output

```
## FPF Status

### Current Phase: DEDUCTION

You have 3 hypotheses in L0 awaiting verification.
Next step: Continue the FPF workflow to process L0 hypotheses.

### Hypothesis Counts

| Layer | Count |
|-------|-------|
| L0 | 3 |
| L1 | 0 |
| L2 | 0 |
| Invalid | 0 |

### Evidence Status

No evidence files yet (hypotheses not validated).

### No Warnings

All systems nominal.
```
