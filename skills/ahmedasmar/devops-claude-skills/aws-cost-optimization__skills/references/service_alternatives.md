## Compute Alternatives

### EC2 vs Lambda vs Fargate

**EC2 (Most Economical for Consistent Workloads)**
- **When to use**: 24/7 workloads, predictable traffic, need full OS control
- **Cost model**: Hourly charges, cheaper with Reserved Instances
- **Best for**: Always-on applications, legacy apps, specific OS/kernel requirements
- **Example**: Web server handling steady traffic → EC2 with Reserved Instance

**Lambda (Most Economical for Intermittent Work)**
- **When to use**: Event-driven, sporadic usage, < 15 minute executions
- **Cost model**: Pay per execution and duration (GB-seconds)
- **Best for**: APIs with sporadic traffic, scheduled tasks, event processing
- **Example**: Image processing triggered by S3 upload → Lambda
- **Break-even**: ~20-30 hours/month execution time vs equivalent EC2

**Fargate (Middle Ground)**
- **When to use**: Containerized apps, variable traffic, don't want to manage servers
- **Cost model**: Pay for vCPU and memory allocated
- **Best for**: Microservices, batch jobs, variable load applications
- **Example**: Background worker that scales 0-10 containers → Fargate
- **Tip**: Fargate Spot offers up to 70% savings for fault-tolerant tasks

**Decision Matrix**
```
Consistent 24/7 load → EC2 with Reserved Instances
Variable load, containerized → Fargate (or Fargate Spot)
Event-driven, < 15 min → Lambda
Batch processing → Fargate Spot or EC2 Spot
```

### EC2 Instance Alternatives

**Standard vs Graviton (ARM64)**
- **Graviton Savings**: 25-30% cheaper with Graviton4 (2024) and Graviton5 (2026) instances
- **When to use**: Modern applications, ARM-compatible workloads
- **Current Graviton families**: T4g (budget), M8g/M9g (general purpose), C8g (compute), R8g (memory)
- **Alternatives**:
  - t3.large → t4g.large
  - m5.xlarge → m8g.xlarge (or m9g.xlarge for latest Graviton5)
  - c5.2xlarge → c8g.2xlarge
- **Note**: Check current pricing at aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing
- **Considerations**: Test application compatibility first

**Current vs Previous Generation**
- **Migration Savings**: 5-10% cheaper, better performance
- **Legacy families (migrate ASAP)**: t2, m4, c4, r4
- **Current generation**: t3/t4g, m5/m6i/m7i/m8g/m9g, c5/c6i/c7i/c8g, r5/r6i/r7i/r8g
- **Examples**:
  - t2 → t3 or t4g (legacy to current)
  - m4 → m5 → m6i → m7i/m8g (progressive improvements)
  - c4 → c5 → c6i → c7i/c8g (better price/performance)
- **Action**: Run `aws ec2 describe-instances` and filter for t2, m4, c4, r4 families

**On-Demand vs Spot vs Reserved**
- **On-Demand**: Highest cost, full flexibility
- **Spot**: 60-90% discount, can be interrupted
- **Reserved (1yr)**: 30-40% discount
- **Reserved (3yr)**: 50-65% discount
- **Decision**: Use Spot for fault-tolerant, RI for predictable, On-Demand for rest
- **Note**: Check current pricing at aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing

**Reserved Capacity (Long-term Commitment)**
- **Cost**: Additional 30-50% discount on provisioned capacity
- **When to use**: Known long-term capacity needs
- **Commitment**: 1-3 years

**Break-Even Calculation**
```
On-Demand: $1.25 per million writes
Provisioned: ~$0.47 per million writes (at capacity)
Break-even: ~65% consistent utilization

Action: Start with on-demand, switch to provisioned once patterns clear
```

### Database Migration Options

**From Commercial to Open Source**
```
Oracle → Aurora PostgreSQL or RDS PostgreSQL
Savings: 90% on licensing costs
Consider: PostgreSQL compatibility, migration effort

SQL Server → Aurora PostgreSQL or RDS PostgreSQL/MySQL
Savings: 50-90% on licensing costs
Consider: Application compatibility, migration effort
```

**From RDS to Aurora**
```
Only if: High availability requirements, many read replicas needed
Cost increase: 20-50% more
Benefit: Better performance, automatic failover, scaling
```

**From Aurora to RDS**
```
When: Don't need Aurora features, cost-conscious
Savings: 20-50%
Downgrade if: Single-AZ sufficient, limited read replicas needed
```

## Cost Comparison Tool

Use this mental model when evaluating alternatives:

```
1. Calculate current monthly cost
2. Calculate alternative monthly cost
3. Estimate migration effort (hours × $cost)
4. Calculate payback period: Migration Cost / Monthly Savings
5. Decide: Payback < 3 months → Likely worth it
           Payback > 6 months → Evaluate carefully
```

**Example:**
```
Current: ALB for static site = $20/month
Alternative: CloudFront + S3 = $2/month
Savings: $18/month
Migration: 4 hours × $100/hour = $400
Payback: $400 / $18 = 22 months → Maybe not worth it

But if: Multiple sites, reusable pattern → Worth the investment
```
