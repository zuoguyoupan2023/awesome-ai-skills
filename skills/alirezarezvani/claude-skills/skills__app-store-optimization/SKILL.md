# App Store Optimization (ASO)

---

## Keyword Research Workflow

Discover and evaluate keywords that drive app store visibility.

### Workflow: Conduct Keyword Research

1. Define target audience and core app functions:
   - Primary use case (what problem does the app solve)
   - Target user demographics
   - Competitive category
2. Generate seed keywords from:
   - App features and benefits
   - User language (not developer terminology)
   - App store autocomplete suggestions
3. Expand keyword list using:
   - Modifiers (free, best, simple)
   - Actions (create, track, organize)
   - Audiences (for students, for teams, for business)
4. Evaluate each keyword:
   - Search volume (estimated monthly searches)
   - Competition (number and quality of ranking apps)
   - Relevance (alignment with app function)
5. Score and prioritize keywords:
   - Primary: Title and keyword field (iOS)
   - Secondary: Subtitle and short description
   - Tertiary: Full description only
6. Map keywords to metadata locations
7. Document keyword strategy for tracking
8. **Validation:** Keywords scored; placement mapped; no competitor brand names included; no plurals in iOS keyword field

### Keyword Evaluation Criteria

| Factor | Weight | High Score Indicators |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| Relevance | 35% | Describes core app function |
| Volume | 25% | 10,000+ monthly searches |
| Competition | 25% | Top 10 apps have <4.5 avg rating |
| Conversion | 15% | Transactional intent ("best X app") |

### Keyword Placement Priority

| Location | Search Weight |
|----------|---------------|
| App Title | Highest |
| Subtitle (iOS) | High |
| Keyword Field (iOS) | High |
| Short Description (Android) | High |
| Full Description | Medium |

## Metadata Optimization Workflow

Optimize app store listing elements for search ranking and conversion.

### Workflow: Optimize App Metadata

1. Audit current metadata against platform limits:
   - Title character count and keyword presence
   - Subtitle/short description usage
   - Keyword field efficiency (iOS)
   - Description keyword density
2. Optimize title following formula:
   ```
   [Brand Name] - [Primary Keyword] [Secondary Keyword]
   ```
3. Write subtitle (iOS) or short description (Android):
   - Focus on primary benefit
   - Include secondary keyword
   - Use action verbs
4. Optimize keyword field (iOS only):
   - Remove duplicates from title
   - Remove plurals (Apple indexes both forms)
   - No spaces after commas
   - Prioritize by score
5. Rewrite full description:
   - Hook paragraph with value proposition
   - Feature bullets with keywords
   - Social proof section
   - Call to action
6. Validate character counts for each field
7. Calculate keyword density (target 2-3% primary)
8. **Validation:** All fields within character limits; primary keyword in title; no keyword stuffing (>5%); natural language preserved

### Platform Character Limits

| Field | Apple App Store | Google Play Store |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Title | 30 characters | 50 characters |
| Subtitle | 30 characters | N/A |
| Short Description | N/A | 80 characters |
| Keywords | 100 characters | N/A |
| Promotional Text | 170 characters | N/A |
| Full Description | 4,000 characters | 4,000 characters |
| What's New | 4,000 characters | 500 characters |

### Description Structure

```
PARAGRAPH 1: Hook (50-100 words)
├── Address user pain point
├── State main value proposition
└── Include primary keyword

PARAGRAPH 2-3: Features (100-150 words)
├── Top 5 features with benefits
├── Bullet points for scanability
└── Secondary keywords naturally integrated

PARAGRAPH 4: Social Proof (50-75 words)
├── Download count or rating
├── Press mentions or awards
└── Summary of user testimonials

PARAGRAPH 5: Call to Action (25-50 words)
├── Clear next step
└── Reassurance (free trial, no signup)
```

## Competitor Analysis Workflow

Analyze top competitors to identify keyword gaps and positioning opportunities.

### Workflow: Analyze Competitor ASO Strategy

1. Identify top 10 competitors:
   - Direct competitors (same core function)
   - Indirect competitors (overlapping audience)
   - Category leaders (top downloads)
2. Extract competitor keywords from:
   - App titles and subtitles
   - First 100 words of descriptions
   - Visible metadata patterns
3. Build competitor keyword matrix:
   - Map which keywords each competitor targets
   - Calculate coverage percentage per keyword
4. Identify keyword gaps:
   - Keywords with <40% competitor coverage
   - High volume terms competitors miss
   - Long-tail opportunities
5. Analyze competitor visual assets:
   - Icon design patterns
   - Screenshot messaging and style
   - Video presence and quality
6. Compare ratings and review patterns:
   - Average rating by competitor
   - Common praise themes
   - Common complaint themes
7. Document positioning opportunities
8. **Validation:** 10+ competitors analyzed; keyword matrix complete; gaps identified with volume estimates; visual audit documented

### Competitor Analysis Matrix

| Analysis Area | Data Points |
|---------------|-------------|
| Keywords | Title keywords, description frequency |
| Metadata | Character utilization, keyword density |
| Visuals | Icon style, screenshot count/style |
| Ratings | Average rating, total count, velocity |
| Reviews | Top praise, top complaints |

### Gap Analysis Template

| Opportunity Type | Example | Action |
|------------------|---------|--------|
| Keyword gap | "habit tracker" (40% coverage) | Add to keyword field |
| Feature gap | Competitor lacks widget | Highlight in screenshots |
| Visual gap | No videos in top 5 | Create app preview |
| Messaging gap | None mention "free" | Test free positioning |

## A/B Testing Workflow

Test metadata and visual elements to improve conversion rates.

### Workflow: Run A/B Test

1. Select test element (prioritize by impact):
   - Icon (highest impact)
   - Screenshot 1 (high impact)
   - Title (high impact)
   - Short description (medium impact)
2. Form hypothesis:
   ```
   If we [change], then [metric] will [improve/increase] by [amount]
   because [rationale].
   ```
3. Create variants:
   - Control: Current version
   - Treatment: Single variable change
4. Calculate required sample size:
   - Baseline conversion rate
   - Minimum detectable effect (usually 5%)
   - Statistical significance (95%)
5. Launch test:
   - Apple: Use Product Page Optimization
   - Android: Use Store Listing Experiments
6. Run test for minimum duration:
   - At least 7 days
   - Until statistical significance reached
7. Analyze results:
   - Compare conversion rates
   - Check statistical significance
   - Document learnings
8. **Validation:** Single variable tested; sample size sufficient; significance reached (95%); results documented; winner implemented

### A/B Test Prioritization

| Element | Conversion Impact | Test Complexity |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| App Icon | 10-25% lift possible | Medium (design needed) |
| Screenshot 1 | 15-35% lift possible | Medium |
| Title | 5-15% lift possible | Low |
| Short Description | 5-10% lift possible | Low |
| Video | 10-20% lift possible | High |

### Sample Size Quick Reference

| Baseline CVR | Impressions Needed (per variant) |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| 1% | 31,000 |
| 2% | 15,500 |
| 5% | 6,200 |
| 10% | 3,100 |

### Test Documentation Template

```
TEST ID: ASO-2025-001
