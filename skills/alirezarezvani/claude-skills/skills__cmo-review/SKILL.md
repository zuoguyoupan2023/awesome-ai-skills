# /cs:cmo-review — CMO Forcing Questions

**Command:** `/cs:cmo-review <plan>`

The narrative-first strategist pressure-tests positioning before debating tactics.

## When to Run

- Before launching any new campaign
- Before changing positioning, tagline, or category
- Before allocating > 10% of marketing budget to a new channel
- Before a major PR moment (funding announcement, product launch)
- When pipeline contribution is declining

## The Six CMO Questions

### 1. ICP (One Real Person)
**Name one real person in your ICP. Company, title, what they do daily, what they hate.**
- Persona ≠ ICP. ICP is real.
- If you can't name one, the ICP isn't sharp enough.

### 2. JTBD
**What job is the customer hiring this product to do, and what's the alternative they use today?**
- One sentence the customer would say out loud.
- "We use spreadsheets" is a valid alternative. So is "we don't."

### 3. Positioning Statement
**One sentence: For [ICP], who needs [job], we are [category] that [differentiator] unlike [alternative].**
- This is the headline. Everything cascades.
- If it doesn't fit in one sentence, it's not positioning yet.

### 4. Distribution Channel
**Where does the customer first hear your name — and is it inbound or outbound at this stage?**
- Name the channel, intent, and the path to first contact.
- PLG, sales-led, content-led, partnership-led — pick a primary.

### 5. CAC Payback
**Per channel: what's CAC, what's payback in months, and is it improving?**
- If a channel's payback is > 18 months, it isn't a channel — it's a hobby.

### 6. Defensibility of Brand
**If a well-funded competitor copies your messaging tomorrow, what's still yours?**
- Category position, founder-market fit, customer love, distribution lock — name one.
