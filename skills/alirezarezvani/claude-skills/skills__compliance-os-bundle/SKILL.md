# Compliance OS — Meta-Orchestrator

Multi-framework compliance program orchestration. **Four decisions, no per-framework deep-dive:**

1. **Which frameworks apply to this company?** — `framework_selector.py` ranks the 12 supported frameworks against a company profile (industry, geography, AI use, medical, financial, headcount, customers, healthcare-PHI, NIS2 essential/important entity, US gov contractor) and returns applicable ones with dependency graph
2. **How much do selected frameworks overlap?** — `cross_framework_mapper.py` computes control-level overlap with confidence rating; outputs unified control matrix + evidence-reuse opportunities
3. **What does a mock audit produce?** — `audit_simulator.py` generates 8–15 finding scenarios with severity distribution matching IIA expectations + interview questions per control
4. **What's the unified evidence checklist?** — `evidence_pool_generator.py` consolidates evidence across enabled frameworks; outputs which artefact satisfies which controls across which frameworks

This skill is **NOT** a per-framework deep-dive. The per-framework skills (`ra-qm-team/skills/iso42001-specialist/`, `compliance-team-eu-ai-act/`, `ra-qm-team/skills/gdpr-dsgvo-expert/`, etc.) do the operational work. Compliance OS orchestrates them.

This skill is **NOT** a substitute for binding legal advice. Cross-framework mappings reflect published guidance (ISO standards, regulations, EDPB/Commission guidance, IIA / AICPA professional standards). Novel cross-walks should be reviewed with counsel.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Decision A: Which frameworks apply for the company?
python scripts/framework_selector.py                          # embedded mid-stage AI SaaS sample
python scripts/framework_selector.py path/to/profile.json

# Decision B: Compute cross-framework overlap
python scripts/cross_framework_mapper.py                      # embedded ISO 27001 + SOC 2 sample
python scripts/cross_framework_mapper.py path/to/control_libs.json

# Decision C: Simulate an audit
python scripts/audit_simulator.py                             # embedded ISO 27001 sample
python scripts/audit_simulator.py path/to/audit_scope.json

# Decision D: Consolidate evidence checklist across frameworks
python scripts/evidence_pool_generator.py                     # embedded 3-framework sample
python scripts/evidence_pool_generator.py path/to/program.json
```

## Key Questions (ask these first)

- **Have you named every applicable framework?** Forgetting one means rebuilding the audit program later. Run `framework_selector.py` with your profile.
- **What's the most certificate / regulation your company already operates?** That's your reuse anchor. Map every new framework against it.
- **What's the audit calendar?** A multi-framework program means surveillance audits stacked through the year — plan auditor independence + capacity.
- **Where is evidence stored?** Multi-framework programs collapse when evidence lives in one team's drive without an index. Run `evidence_pool_generator.py` to surface the reuse opportunities.
- **What's the management-review cadence across frameworks?** Each framework wants its own management review, but a single integrated review (per ISO Annex SL) typically satisfies all of them with one calendar slot.
- **Who owns the meta-program?** If no single accountable role, the program fragments.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Framework Selection

**The framework:** company-profile JSON in → applicable-framework list out with dependency graph.

**Deterministic logic:**
- Medical device → ISO 13485 + ISO 14971 + (EU MDR 745 if EU market) + (FDA QSR if US market)
- Customer-facing AI → ISO 42001 + EU AI Act (if EU users) + GDPR (if personal data)
- B2B SaaS with enterprise customers → SOC 2 + ISO 27001 (often required for procurement)
- EU customers + personal data → GDPR mandatory
- Highly regulated industry (financial, health) → additional sectoral overlays

**Run** `framework_selector.py` to apply the decision rules.

### 2. Cross-Framework Control Mapping

**The framework:** for each selected framework, parse its control library; compute overlap with other selected frameworks.

**Per merged-control output:**
- Mapping confidence (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW)
- Evidence-reuse opportunity (single artefact satisfies N controls)
- Per-framework citation
- Implementation guidance reusable across frameworks

**Densest known overlap:** ISO 27001 Annex A ↔ SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria — historically ~75% control coverage shared. Adding ISO 42001 brings AI-specific controls; adding GDPR brings privacy-specific.

**Run** `cross_framework_mapper.py` with framework control libraries.

### 3. Audit Simulation

**The framework:** generate a realistic mock internal audit per ISO 19011 + IIA IPPF standards.

**Per audit output:**
- 8–15 finding scenarios per ISO 19011 typical depth
- Severity distribution: ≥ 40% observations/OFI, ≤ 15% critical/major (IIA expectation for healthy programs)
- Interview questions per scoped control (3–5 questions per control)
- Document-review request list
- Walk-through requests where applicable

**Run** `audit_simulator.py` with framework + scope.

### 4. Evidence Pool

**The framework:** consolidate evidence requirements across enabled frameworks; identify reuse opportunities.

**Output:**
- Evidence artefact list (e.g., access-review log, supplier risk register, incident log)
- Per artefact: list of (framework, control) tuples it satisfies
- Reuse-leverage score (artefact A satisfies N controls across M frameworks)
- Acquisition cost estimate (effort to produce + maintain)

**Run** `evidence_pool_generator.py` with program config.

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Program Bootstrap (multi-framework, 4–8 weeks)
**Goal:** stand up a compliance program covering 2–4 frameworks simultaneously.

```bash
# 1. Run framework selector with company profile
python scripts/framework_selector.py profile.json
# 2. For each applicable framework, identify the per-framework skill and run its gap analysis
# 3. Run cross-framework mapper to identify reuse opportunities
python scripts/cross_framework_mapper.py control_libs.json
# 4. Run evidence pool generator to consolidate
python scripts/evidence_pool_generator.py program.json
# 5. Cross-check with cs-compliance-officer agent
# 6. Output: prioritized program backlog with owners + dates
```

### Workflow 2: Annual Audit Calendar (yearly)
**Goal:** plan internal audit cycles covering all applicable frameworks.

```bash
# 1. Refresh framework selector if profile changed
python scripts/framework_selector.py profile.json
# 2. For each framework, run its internal-audit-plan tool
#    (e.g., aims_audit_scheduler.py for ISO 42001; isms_audit_scheduler.py for ISO 27001)
# 3. Coordinate the audit calendar across frameworks (auditor independence + capacity)
# 4. Run audit simulator for each framework to prep auditors
python scripts/audit_simulator.py scope.json
# 5. Output: integrated audit calendar with owners + auditor assignments
```

### Workflow 3: Pre-Certification Readiness (per new framework, 6–12 weeks)
**Goal:** prepare for an external certification audit.

```bash
# 1. Run gap analysis for the new framework
#    (ISO 42001: aims_gap_analyzer.py; ISO 27001: compliance_checker.py; SOC 2: gap_analyzer.py)
# 2. Run cross-framework mapper against already-certified frameworks
python scripts/cross_framework_mapper.py control_libs.json
# 3. Reuse evidence for HIGH-confidence mappings; build new for MEDIUM/LOW
# 4. Run audit simulator to dry-run the certification audit
python scripts/audit_simulator.py scope.json
# 5. Close remaining gaps before external auditor stage 1
```

### Workflow 4: Evidence Pool Consolidation (quarterly)
**Goal:** keep the unified evidence pool fresh + reusable.

```bash
# 1. Refresh evidence pool generator
python scripts/evidence_pool_generator.py program.json
# 2. Identify HIGH-reuse-leverage artefacts (1 evidence -> 5+ controls)
# 3. Confirm evidence freshness (within retention requirement per framework)
# 4. Audit the evidence pool itself (no orphan controls, no stale evidence)
```

## Output Standards

```
**Bottom Line:** [one sentence — what's the multi-framework picture + biggest reuse opportunity]
**The Decision:** [one of: framework-set | overlap-map | audit-plan | evidence-consolidation]
**The Evidence:** [framework names + control IDs from the tool, not adjectives]
**How to Act:** [3 concrete next steps with owners + dates]
**Your Decision:** [the call only the compliance officer can make — which frameworks to pursue, audit cycle priority, evidence-reuse policy]
```
