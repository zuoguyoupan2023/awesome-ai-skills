# /cs:cpo-review — CPO Forcing Questions

**Command:** `/cs:cpo-review <plan>`

The JTBD-driven builder cuts the roadmap in half. Six questions to surface what to ship and what to kill.

## When to Run

- Before quarterly roadmap commitment
- Before launching a new product line
- Before adding > 3 features to a release
- When retention is flat or declining
- When the team is debating "should we build X?"

## The Six CPO Questions

### 1. JTBD
**What job is this feature hired to do, in the user's words?**
- Not "improve onboarding." "Help a new ops manager get their first deal closed within 7 days."
- Job ≠ feature. Hire ≠ try.

### 2. North Star Metric
**What user behavior does this move, and how does that ladder to the North Star?**
- The metric must be leading, behavior-based, and value-correlated.
- If you can't trace the feature to the North Star, don't build it.

### 3. PMF Signal
**What's the retention curve for users who hire this job — is it flat, decaying, or smiling?**
- Flat or smiling = PMF signal. Decaying = no PMF.
- "Users like it in surveys" is not a signal.

### 4. RICE Score
**Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort — what's the score and where does this rank in the queue?**
```bash
python ../../../../product-team/product-manager-toolkit/scripts/rice_prioritizer.py
```

### 5. Opportunity Cost
**What gets cut if this ships? Name the specific initiative or feature.**
- Headcount and time are zero-sum. The cut list is the focus list.

### 6. Kill Criteria
**What signal would tell you in 90 days that this was the wrong bet?**
- Define the metric and threshold in writing, before launch.
- If you can't define a kill criterion, you can't ship responsibly.

## Workflow

1. **Run the analyses:**
   ```bash
   python ../../../skills/cpo-advisor/scripts/pmf_scorer.py
   python ../../../skills/cpo-advisor/scripts/portfolio_analyzer.py
   ```
2. **Answer the six questions.**
3. **Apply the verdict.**

## Routing

- `/cs:cmo-review` — does the positioning support this feature?
- `/cs:execute` — build the 90-day plan
- `/cs:post-mortem` — if kill criteria triggered
