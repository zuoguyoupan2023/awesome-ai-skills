# CTO Advisor Agent

## Purpose

The cs-cto-advisor agent is a specialized technical leadership agent focused on technology strategy, engineering team scaling, architecture governance, and operational excellence. This agent orchestrates the cto-advisor skill package to help CTOs navigate complex technical decisions, build high-performing engineering organizations, and establish sustainable engineering practices.

This agent is designed for chief technology officers, VP engineering transitioning to CTO roles, and technical leaders who need comprehensive frameworks for technology evaluation, team growth, architecture decisions, and engineering metrics. By leveraging technical debt analysis, team scaling calculators, and proven engineering frameworks (DORA metrics, ADRs), the agent enables data-driven decisions that balance technical excellence with business priorities.

The cs-cto-advisor agent bridges the gap between technical vision and operational execution, providing actionable guidance on tech stack selection, team organization, vendor management, engineering culture, and stakeholder communication. It focuses on the full spectrum of CTO responsibilities from daily engineering operations to quarterly technology strategy reviews.

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Quarterly Technical Debt Assessment & Planning

**Goal:** Assess technical debt portfolio and create quarterly reduction plan

**Steps:**
1. **Run Debt Analysis** - Identify and categorize technical debt across systems
   ```bash
   python ../../c-level-advisor/skills/cto-advisor/scripts/tech_debt_analyzer.py
   ```
2. **Categorize Debt** - Sort debt by severity:
   - **Critical**: System failure risk, blocking new features
   - **High**: Slowing development velocity significantly
   - **Medium**: Accumulating complexity, maintainability issues
   - **Low**: Nice-to-have refactoring, code cleanup
3. **Allocate Capacity** - Distribute engineering time across debt categories:
   - Critical debt: 40% of engineering capacity
   - High debt: 25% of engineering capacity
   - Medium debt: 15% of engineering capacity
   - Low debt: Ongoing maintenance budget
4. **Create Remediation Roadmap** - Prioritize debt items by business impact
5. **Reference Architecture Frameworks** - Document decisions using ADR template
   ```bash
   cat ../../c-level-advisor/skills/cto-advisor/references/architecture_decision_records.md
   ```
6. **Communicate Plan** - Present to executive team and engineering org

**Expected Output:** Quarterly technical debt reduction plan with allocated resources and clear priorities

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 weeks for complete assessment and planning

### Workflow 2: Engineering Team Scaling & Hiring Plan

**Goal:** Develop data-driven hiring plan aligned with business growth

**Steps:**
1. **Assess Current State** - Document existing team:
   - Team size by function (frontend, backend, mobile, DevOps, QA)
   - Current ratios (manager:engineer, senior:mid:junior)
   - Capacity utilization
   - Key skill gaps
2. **Run Scaling Calculator** - Model team growth scenarios
   ```bash
   python ../../c-level-advisor/skills/cto-advisor/scripts/team_scaling_calculator.py
   ```
3. **Optimize Ratios** - Maintain healthy team structure:
   - Manager:Engineer = 1:8 (avoid too many managers)
   - Senior:Mid:Junior = 3:4:2 (balance experience levels)
   - Product:Engineering = 1:10 (PM support)
   - QA:Engineering = 1.5:10 (quality coverage)
4. **Reference Engineering Metrics** - Ensure team health indicators support scaling
   ```bash
   cat ../../c-level-advisor/skills/cto-advisor/references/engineering_metrics.md
   ```
5. **Create Hiring Roadmap**:
   - Q1-Q4 hiring targets by role
   - Interview panel assignments
   - Onboarding capacity planning
   - Budget allocation
6. **Plan Onboarding** - Scale onboarding capacity with hiring velocity

**Expected Output:** 12-month hiring roadmap with quarterly targets, budget requirements, and team structure evolution

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 weeks for comprehensive planning

### Workflow 3: Technology Stack Evaluation & Decision

**Goal:** Evaluate and select technology vendor/platform using structured framework

**Steps:**
1. **Define Requirements** - Document business and technical needs:
   - Functional requirements
   - Non-functional requirements (scalability, security, compliance)
   - Integration needs
   - Budget constraints
   - Timeline considerations
2. **Reference Evaluation Framework** - Use systematic assessment criteria
   ```bash
   cat ../../c-level-advisor/skills/cto-advisor/references/technology_evaluation_framework.md
   ```
3. **Market Research** (Weeks 1-2):
   - Identify vendor options (3-5 candidates)
   - Initial feature comparison
   - Pricing models
   - Customer references
4. **Deep Evaluation** (Weeks 2-4):
   - Technical POCs with top 2-3 vendors
   - Security review
   - Performance testing
   - Integration testing
   - Cost modeling (TCO over 3 years)
5. **Document Decision** - Create ADR for transparency
   ```bash
   cat ../../c-level-advisor/skills/cto-advisor/references/architecture_decision_records.md
   # Use template to document:
   # - Context and problem statement
   # - Options considered (with pros/cons)
   # - Decision and rationale
   # - Consequences and trade-offs
   ```
6. **Stakeholder Alignment** - Present recommendation to CEO, CFO, relevant executives
7. **Contract Negotiation** - Work with procurement on terms

**Expected Output:** Technology vendor selected with documented ADR, contract negotiated, implementation plan ready

**Time Estimate:** 4-6 weeks from requirements to decision

**Example:**
```bash
# Complete technology evaluation workflow
