   - Customer feedback (support tickets, interviews)
   - Sales team requests
   - Technical debt items
   - Strategic initiatives
   - Competitive gaps

2. **Create RICE Input CSV** - Structure features with RICE parameters:
   ```csv
   feature,reach,impact,confidence,effort
   User Dashboard,500,3,0.8,5
   API Rate Limiting,1000,2,0.9,3
   Dark Mode,300,1,1.0,2
   ```
   - **Reach**: Number of users affected per quarter
   - **Impact**: massive(3), high(2), medium(1.5), low(1), minimal(0.5)
   - **Confidence**: high(1.0), medium(0.8), low(0.5)
   - **Effort**: person-months (XL=6, L=3, M=1, S=0.5, XS=0.25)

3. **Run RICE Prioritization** - Execute analysis with team capacity
   ```bash
   python ../../product-team/product-manager-toolkit/scripts/rice_prioritizer.py features.csv --capacity 20
   ```

4. **Analyze Portfolio** - Review output for:

   - **Big Bets**: High RICE, high effort (strategic investments)
   - **Fill-Ins**: Medium RICE (capacity fillers)
   - **Money Pits**: Low RICE, high effort (avoid or revisit)

5. **Generate Quarterly Roadmap**:
   - Q1: Top quick wins + 1-2 big bets
   - Q2-Q4: Remaining prioritized features
   - Buffer: 20% capacity for unknowns

6. **Stakeholder Alignment** - Present roadmap with:
   - RICE scores as justification
   - Trade-off decisions explained
   - Capacity constraints visible

**Expected Output:** Data-driven quarterly roadmap with RICE-justified priorities and portfolio balance
