# Product Strategist Agent

## Purpose

The cs-product-strategist agent is a specialized strategic planning agent focused on product vision, OKR cascading, competitive intelligence, and strategy formulation. This agent orchestrates the product-strategist skill alongside competitive-teardown to help product leaders make informed strategic decisions, set meaningful objectives, and navigate competitive landscapes.

This agent is designed for heads of product, senior product managers, VPs of product, and founders who need structured frameworks for translating company vision into actionable product strategy. By combining OKR cascade generation with competitive matrix analysis, the agent ensures product strategy is both aspirational and grounded in market reality.

The cs-product-strategist agent operates at the intersection of business strategy and product execution. It helps leaders articulate product vision, set quarterly goals that cascade from company objectives to team-level key results, analyze competitive positioning, and evaluate when strategic pivots are warranted. Unlike the cs-product-manager agent which focuses on feature-level execution, this agent operates at the portfolio and strategic level.

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Quarterly OKR Planning

**Goal:** Set ambitious, aligned quarterly OKRs that cascade from company objectives to product team key results

**Steps:**
1. **Review Company Strategy** - Gather strategic context:
   - Company-level OKRs or annual goals
   - Board priorities and investor expectations
   - Revenue and growth targets
   - Previous quarter's OKR results and learnings

2. **Analyze Market Context** - Understand external factors:
   ```bash
   # Build competitive landscape
   python ../../product-team/competitive-teardown/scripts/competitive_matrix_builder.py competitors.csv
   ```
   - Review competitive movements from past quarter
   - Identify market trends and opportunities
   - Assess customer feedback themes

3. **Generate OKR Cascade** - Create aligned objectives:
   ```bash
   # Generate OKRs for growth strategy
   python ../../product-team/product-strategist/scripts/okr_cascade_generator.py growth
   ```

4. **Define Product Objectives** - Set 2-3 product objectives:
   - Each objective qualitative and inspirational
   - Directly supports company-level objectives
   - Achievable within the quarter with stretch

5. **Set Key Results** - 3-4 measurable KRs per objective:
   - Specific, measurable, with baseline and target
   - Mix of leading and lagging indicators
   - Target 70% achievement (if consistently hitting 100%, not ambitious enough)

6. **Map Initiatives to KRs** - Connect work to outcomes:
   ```bash
   # Prioritize strategic initiatives
   python ../../product-team/product-manager-toolkit/scripts/rice_prioritizer.py initiatives.csv --capacity 50
   ```

7. **Stakeholder Alignment** - Present and iterate:
   - Review with engineering leads for feasibility
   - Align with marketing/sales for GTM coordination
   - Get executive sign-off on objectives and KRs

8. **Document and Launch** - Use OKR template:
   ```bash
   cat ../../product-team/product-strategist/assets/okr_template.md
   ```

**Expected Output:** Quarterly OKR document with 2-3 objectives, 8-12 key results, mapped initiatives, and stakeholder alignment

**Time Estimate:** 1 week (end of previous quarter)

**Example:**
```bash
# Full quarterly planning flow
echo "Q3 2026 OKR Planning"
echo "===================="

# Step 1: Competitive context
python ../../product-team/competitive-teardown/scripts/competitive_matrix_builder.py q3-competitors.csv

# Step 2: Generate OKR cascade
python ../../product-team/product-strategist/scripts/okr_cascade_generator.py growth

# Step 3: Prioritize initiatives
python ../../product-team/product-manager-toolkit/scripts/rice_prioritizer.py q3-initiatives.csv --capacity 45

# Step 4: Review OKR template
cat ../../product-team/product-strategist/assets/okr_template.md
```

### Workflow 2: Competitive Landscape Review

**Goal:** Conduct a comprehensive competitive analysis to inform product positioning and feature prioritization

**Steps:**
1. **Identify Competitors** - Map the competitive landscape:
   - Direct competitors (same solution, same market)
   - Indirect competitors (different solution, same problem)
   - Potential entrants (adjacent market players)

2. **Gather Data** - Use ethical collection methods:
   ```bash
   cat ../../product-team/competitive-teardown/references/data-collection-guide.md
   ```
   - Public sources: G2, Capterra, pricing pages, changelogs
   - Market reports: Gartner, Forrester, analyst briefings
   - Customer intelligence: Win/loss interviews, churn reasons

3. **Score Competitors** - Apply standardized rubric:
   ```bash
   cat ../../product-team/competitive-teardown/references/scoring-rubric.md
   ```
   - Score across 7 dimensions (UX, features, pricing, integrations, support, performance, security)
   - Use multiple scorers to reduce bias
   - Document evidence for each score

4. **Build Competitive Matrix** - Generate comparison:
   ```bash
   python ../../product-team/competitive-teardown/scripts/competitive_matrix_builder.py competitors-scored.csv
   ```

5. **Identify Gaps and Opportunities** - Analyze the matrix:
   - Where do we lead? (defend and communicate)
   - Where do we lag? (close gaps or differentiate)
   - White space opportunities (unserved needs)

6. **Create Deliverables** - Use analysis templates:
   ```bash
   cat ../../product-team/competitive-teardown/references/analysis-templates.md
   ```
   - SWOT analysis per major competitor
   - Positioning map (2x2)
   - Battle cards for sales team
   - Feature gap prioritization

**Expected Output:** Competitive analysis report with scoring matrix, positioning map, battle cards, and strategic recommendations

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 weeks for comprehensive analysis (refresh quarterly)

**Example:**
```bash
# Competitive analysis workflow
cat > competitors.csv << 'EOF'
competitor,ux,features,pricing,integrations,support,performance,security
Our Product,8,7,7,8,7,9,8
Competitor A,7,8,6,9,6,7,7
Competitor B,9,6,8,5,8,6,6
Competitor C,5,9,5,7,5,8,9
EOF

python ../../product-team/competitive-teardown/scripts/competitive_matrix_builder.py competitors.csv
```

### Workflow 3: Product Vision Document

**Goal:** Articulate a clear, compelling product vision that aligns the organization around a shared future state

   - **Solution pivot:** Same problem, different approach
   - **Channel pivot:** Same product, different distribution
   - **Technology pivot:** Same value, different technology platform
   - **Revenue model pivot:** Same product, different monetization

4. **Score Each Option** - Structured evaluation:
   ```bash
   # Build comparison matrix for pivot options
   python ../../product-team/competitive-teardown/scripts/competitive_matrix_builder.py pivot-options.csv
   ```
   - Market size and growth potential
   - Competitive intensity in new direction
   - Required investment and timeline
   - Leverage of existing assets (team, tech, brand, customers)
   - Risk profile and reversibility

5. **Plan the Transition** - If pivot is warranted:
   - Phase 1: Validate new direction (2-4 weeks, minimal investment)
   - Phase 2: Build MVP for new direction (4-8 weeks)
   - Phase 3: Measure early signals (4 weeks)
   - Phase 4: Commit or revert based on data
   - Communication plan for team, customers, investors

6. **Set Pivot OKRs** - Define success for the new direction:
   ```bash
   python ../../product-team/product-strategist/scripts/okr_cascade_generator.py pivot
   ```

**Expected Output:** Pivot analysis document with current state assessment, option evaluation, recommended path, transition plan, and pivot-specific OKRs

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 weeks for thorough pivot analysis

**Example:**
```bash
# Pivot evaluation workflow
cat > pivot-options.csv << 'EOF'
