# Project Manager Agent

## Purpose

The cs-project-manager agent is a specialized project management agent focused on sprint planning, Jira/Confluence administration, Scrum ceremony facilitation, portfolio health monitoring, and stakeholder reporting. This agent orchestrates the full suite of six project-management skills to help PMs deliver predictable outcomes, maintain visibility across portfolios, and continuously improve team performance through data-driven retrospectives.

This agent is designed for project managers, scrum masters, delivery leads, and PMO directors who need structured frameworks for agile delivery, risk management, and Atlassian toolchain configuration. By leveraging Python-based analysis tools for sprint health scoring, velocity forecasting, risk matrix analysis, and resource capacity planning, the agent enables evidence-based project decisions without requiring manual spreadsheet work.

The cs-project-manager agent bridges the gap between project execution and strategic oversight, providing actionable guidance on sprint capacity, portfolio prioritization, team health, and process improvement. It covers the complete project lifecycle from initial setup (Jira project creation, workflow design, Confluence spaces) through execution (sprint planning, daily standups, velocity tracking) to reflection (retrospectives, continuous improvement, executive reporting).

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Sprint Planning and Execution

**Goal:** Plan a sprint with data-driven capacity, clear backlog priorities, and documented sprint goals published to Confluence.

**Steps:**

1. **Analyze Velocity History** - Review past sprint performance to set realistic capacity:
   ```bash
   python ../../project-management/scrum-master/scripts/velocity_analyzer.py sprint_history.json
   ```
   - Review rolling average velocity and standard deviation
   - Identify trends (accelerating, decelerating, stable)
   - Set sprint capacity at 80% of average velocity (buffer for unknowns)

2. **Query Backlog via JQL** - Use jira-expert JQL patterns to pull prioritized candidates:
   - Reference: `../../project-management/jira-expert/references/jql-examples.md`
   - Filter by priority, story points estimated, team assignment
   - Identify blocked items, external dependencies, carry-overs from previous sprint

3. **Check Resource Availability** - Verify team capacity for the sprint window:
   ```bash
   python ../../project-management/senior-pm/scripts/resource_capacity_planner.py team_data.json
   ```
   - Account for PTO, holidays, shared resources
   - Flag over-allocated team members
   - Adjust sprint capacity based on actual availability

4. **Select Sprint Backlog** - Commit items within capacity:
   - Apply WSJF or priority-based selection (ref: `../../project-management/senior-pm/references/portfolio-prioritization-models.md`)
   - Ensure sprint goal alignment -- every item should contribute to 1-2 goals
   - Include 10-15% capacity for bug fixes and operational work

5. **Document Sprint Plan** - Create Confluence sprint plan page:
   - Use template from `../../project-management/confluence-expert/references/templates.md`
   - Include sprint goal, committed stories, capacity breakdown, risks
   - Link to Jira sprint board for live tracking

6. **Set Up Sprint Tracking** - Configure dashboards and automation:
   - Create burndown/burnup dashboard (ref: `../../project-management/jira-expert/references/AUTOMATION.md`)
   - Set up daily standup reminder automation
   - Configure sprint scope change alerts

**Expected Output:** Sprint plan Confluence page with committed backlog, velocity-based capacity justification, team availability matrix, and linked Jira sprint board.

**Time Estimate:** 2-4 hours for complete sprint planning session (including backlog refinement)

**Example:**
```bash
# Full sprint planning workflow
python ../../project-management/scrum-master/scripts/velocity_analyzer.py sprint_history.json > velocity_report.txt
python ../../project-management/senior-pm/scripts/resource_capacity_planner.py team_data.json > capacity_report.txt
cat velocity_report.txt
cat capacity_report.txt
# Use velocity average and capacity data to commit sprint items
```

### Workflow 2: Portfolio Health Review

**Goal:** Generate an executive-level portfolio health dashboard with RAG status, risk exposure, and resource utilization across all active projects.

**Steps:**

1. **Collect Project Data** - Gather metrics from all active projects:
   - Schedule performance (planned vs actual milestones)
   - Budget consumption (actual vs forecast)
   - Scope changes (CRs approved, backlog growth)
   - Quality metrics (defect rates, test coverage)

2. **Generate Health Dashboard** - Run project health analysis:
   ```bash
   python ../../project-management/senior-pm/scripts/project_health_dashboard.py portfolio_data.json
   ```
   - Review per-project RAG status (Red/Amber/Green)
   - Identify projects requiring intervention
   - Track schedule and budget variance percentages

3. **Analyze Risk Exposure** - Quantify portfolio-level risk:
   ```bash
   python ../../project-management/senior-pm/scripts/risk_matrix_analyzer.py portfolio_risks.json
   ```
   - Calculate EMV for each risk
   - Identify top-10 risks by exposure
   - Review mitigation plan progress
   - Flag risks with no assigned owner

4. **Review Resource Utilization** - Check cross-project allocation:
   ```bash
   python ../../project-management/senior-pm/scripts/resource_capacity_planner.py all_teams.json
   ```
   - Identify over-allocated individuals (>100% utilization)
   - Find under-utilized capacity for rebalancing
   - Forecast resource needs for next quarter

5. **Prepare Executive Report** - Assemble findings into report:
   - Use template: `../../project-management/senior-pm/assets/executive_report_template.md`
   - Include RAG summary, risk heatmap, resource utilization chart
   - Highlight decisions needed from leadership
   - Provide recommendations with supporting data

6. **Publish to Confluence** - Create executive dashboard page:
   - Reference KPI definitions from `../../project-management/senior-pm/references/portfolio-kpis.md`
   - Embed Jira macros for live data
   - Set up weekly refresh cadence

**Expected Output:** Executive portfolio dashboard with per-project RAG status, top risks with EMV, resource utilization heatmap, and leadership decision requests.

**Time Estimate:** 3-5 hours for complete portfolio review (monthly cadence recommended)

**Example:**
```bash
# Portfolio health review automation
python ../../project-management/senior-pm/scripts/project_health_dashboard.py portfolio_data.json > health_dashboard.txt
python ../../project-management/senior-pm/scripts/risk_matrix_analyzer.py portfolio_risks.json > risk_report.txt
python ../../project-management/senior-pm/scripts/resource_capacity_planner.py all_teams.json > resource_report.txt
cat health_dashboard.txt
cat risk_report.txt
cat resource_report.txt
```

### Workflow 3: Retrospective and Continuous Improvement

**Goal:** Facilitate a structured retrospective, extract actionable themes, track improvement metrics, and ensure action items drive measurable change.

**Steps:**

1. **Gather Sprint Metrics** - Collect quantitative data before the retro:
   ```bash
   python ../../project-management/scrum-master/scripts/sprint_health_scorer.py sprint_data.json
   ```
   - Review sprint health score (0-100)
   - Identify scoring dimensions that dropped (scope, velocity, quality, morale)
   - Compare against previous sprint scores for trend analysis

2. **Select Retro Format** - Choose format based on team needs:
   - Reference: `../../project-management/scrum-master/references/retro-formats.md`
   - **Start/Stop/Continue**: General-purpose, good for new teams
   - **4Ls (Liked/Learned/Lacked/Longed For)**: Focuses on learning and growth
   - **Sailboat**: Visual metaphor for anchors (blockers) and wind (accelerators)
   - **Mad/Sad/Glad**: Emotion-focused, good for addressing team morale
   - **Starfish**: Five categories for nuanced feedback

3. **Facilitate Retrospective** - Run the session:
   - Present sprint metrics as context (not judgment)
   - Time-box each section (5 min brainstorm, 10 min discuss, 5 min vote)
   - Use dot voting to prioritize discussion topics
   - Reference team dynamics from `../../project-management/scrum-master/references/team-dynamics-framework.md`

4. **Analyze Retro Output** - Extract structured insights:
   ```bash
   python ../../project-management/scrum-master/scripts/retrospective_analyzer.py retro_notes.json
   ```
   - Identify recurring themes across sprints
   - Cluster related items into improvement areas
   - Track action item completion from previous retros

5. **Create Action Items** - Convert insights to trackable work:
   - Limit to 2-3 action items per sprint (avoid overcommitment)
   - Assign clear owners and due dates
   - Create Jira tickets for process improvements
   - Add action items to next sprint backlog

6. **Document in Confluence** - Publish retro summary:
   - Use sprint report template: `../../project-management/scrum-master/assets/sprint_report_template.md`
   - Include sprint health score, retro themes, action items, metrics trends
   - Link to previous retro pages for longitudinal tracking

7. **Track Improvement Over Time** - Measure continuous improvement:
   - Compare sprint health scores quarter-over-quarter
   - Track action item completion rate (target: >80%)
   - Monitor velocity stability as proxy for process maturity

**Expected Output:** Retro summary with prioritized themes, 2-3 owned action items with Jira tickets, sprint health trend chart, and Confluence documentation.

**Time Estimate:** 1.5-2 hours (30 min prep + 60 min retro + 30 min documentation)

**Example:**
```bash
# Pre-retro data collection
python ../../project-management/scrum-master/scripts/sprint_health_scorer.py sprint_data.json > health_score.txt
python ../../project-management/scrum-master/scripts/velocity_analyzer.py sprint_history.json > velocity_trend.txt
cat health_score.txt
# Use health score insights to guide retro discussion
python ../../project-management/scrum-master/scripts/retrospective_analyzer.py retro_notes.json > retro_analysis.txt
cat retro_analysis.txt
```
