## Core Workflows

### 1. Setup & Onboarding

**Goal:** Get gws CLI installed, authenticated, and verified.

**Steps:**
1. Run `gws_doctor.py` to check installation and existing auth
2. If not installed, guide through installation (npm/cargo/binary)
3. Run `auth_setup_guide.py --guide oauth` for auth instructions
4. Run `auth_setup_guide.py --scopes <services>` to identify required scopes
5. Run `auth_setup_guide.py --validate` to verify all services
6. Generate `.env` template with `auth_setup_guide.py --generate-env`

**Example:**
```bash
python3 ../../engineering-team/google-workspace-cli/scripts/gws_doctor.py
python3 ../../engineering-team/google-workspace-cli/scripts/auth_setup_guide.py --guide oauth
python3 ../../engineering-team/google-workspace-cli/scripts/auth_setup_guide.py --validate --json
```

### 2. Daily Operations

**Goal:** Execute persona-based daily workflows using recipes.

**Steps:**
1. Identify user's role and select persona with `gws_recipe_runner.py --personas`
2. List relevant recipes with `gws_recipe_runner.py --persona <role> --list`
3. Execute recipes with `gws_recipe_runner.py --run <name>` (use `--dry-run` first)
4. Pipe output through `output_analyzer.py` for filtering and analysis

**Example:**
```bash
python3 ../../engineering-team/google-workspace-cli/scripts/gws_recipe_runner.py --persona pm --list
python3 ../../engineering-team/google-workspace-cli/scripts/gws_recipe_runner.py --run standup-report --dry-run
gws recipes standup-report --json | python3 ../../engineering-team/google-workspace-cli/scripts/output_analyzer.py --format table
```

### 3. Security Audit

**Goal:** Audit Workspace security configuration and remediate findings.

**Steps:**
1. Run `workspace_audit.py` for full security assessment
2. Review findings, prioritizing FAIL items
3. Filter findings through `output_analyzer.py` for actionable items
4. Execute remediation commands from audit output
5. Re-run audit to verify fixes

**Example:**
```bash
python3 ../../engineering-team/google-workspace-cli/scripts/workspace_audit.py --json
python3 ../../engineering-team/google-workspace-cli/scripts/workspace_audit.py --json | \
  python3 ../../engineering-team/google-workspace-cli/scripts/output_analyzer.py --filter "status=FAIL"
```

### 4. Automation Scripting

**Goal:** Generate multi-step gws scripts for recurring operations.

**Steps:**
1. Identify the workflow from recipe templates
2. Use `gws_recipe_runner.py --describe <name>` for command sequences
3. Customize commands with user-specific parameters
4. Test with `--dry-run` flag
5. Combine into shell scripts or scheduled tasks using `workspace-config.json` template

**Example:**
```bash
python3 ../../engineering-team/google-workspace-cli/scripts/gws_recipe_runner.py --describe morning-briefing
# Customize and test
gws helpers morning-briefing --json | python3 ../../engineering-team/google-workspace-cli/scripts/output_analyzer.py --select "type,summary,time" --format table
```

## Output Standards

- Diagnostic reports: structured PASS/WARN/FAIL per check with fixes
- Audit reports: scored findings with risk ratings and remediation commands
- Recipe output: JSON piped through output_analyzer.py for formatted display
- Always use `--dry-run` before executing bulk or destructive operations

## Success Metrics

- **Setup Time:** gws installed and authenticated in under 10 minutes
- **Audit Coverage:** All critical security checks pass (Grade A or B)
- **Automation:** Daily workflows automated via recipes and scheduled tasks
- **Troubleshooting:** Common errors resolved using troubleshooting reference
