# /cs:gdpr-audit-prep — GDPR DPO Forcing Questions

**Command:** `/cs:gdpr-audit-prep <scope>`

The GDPR DPO auditor pressure-tests any privacy compliance work. Six Article-cited questions before any internal audit, breach response, DPA investigation, or acquisition due diligence.

## When to Run

- Before annual internal GDPR audit
- Before quarterly Article 30 RoPA refresh
- Before launching new high-risk processing (Article 35 DPIA required)
- Post-breach (Articles 33-34)
- Before DPA investigation response or supervisory authority engagement
- During acquisition due diligence (target company privacy posture)
- Quarterly during high-volume new-feature shipping

## The Six DPO Questions

### 1. Show me the Article 30 RoPA — with last-updated date.
**Most-cited finding area.**
- Must include all Article 30(1)(a)-(g) elements for controllers
- Must include all Article 30(2)(a)-(d) elements for processors
- Updated within reasonable time of changes (90 days expected)
- Joint controller arrangements documented per Article 26

### 2. For this processing activity, what's the lawful basis under Article 6?
**Article 6 is exclusive — pick ONE basis per purpose.**
- Six options: consent / contract / legal obligation / vital interests / public task / legitimate interests
- Where "legitimate interests": LIA documented
- Where "consent": records per Article 7; withdrawal mechanism
- Special categories (Article 9) require an Article 9(2) exception

### 3. For high-risk processing, where's the DPIA per Article 35?
**Required for high-risk; sample 3-5 activities.**
- Article 35(7)(a)-(d) required elements:
  - Systematic description of processing
  - Necessity + proportionality assessment
  - Risks to rights + freedoms
  - Measures to address risks
- DPO consulted per Article 35(2)
- Article 36 prior consultation triggered for residual high risk
- For AI systems: integrates with EU AI Act Article 27 FRIA (cross-check with cs-ai-act-compliance)

### 4. Show me a DSAR from the last 30 days — and the response timing.
**Articles 15-22 operational workflow.**
- Response within 1 month (Article 12(3)); extension up to 2 months for complex requests
- Identity verification process documented
- Right of access response includes all Article 15 information
- Right to erasure (Article 17) workflow covers backups + processors

### 5. Show me Transfer Impact Assessments for the largest non-EU transfers.
**Schrems II discipline.**
- Adequacy decision OR SCCs (Article 46) OR derogation (Article 49)
- TIA per EDPB Recommendations 01/2020 + 02/2020
- Supplementary measures where TIA flagged risk
- US transfers covered by EU-US Data Privacy Framework adequacy (Jul 2023) — verify list of certified entities

### 6. Show me the breach log per Article 33(5) — all breaches, not just notifiable ones.
**Article 33(5) requires logging ALL breaches.**
- Internal breach detection mechanism documented
- Article 33 DPA notification within 72 hours (where required)
- Article 34 data subject notification (where high risk)
- Root cause + corrective action via CAPA system
- Cross-check with cs-ciso-iso27001 for A.5.24-27 incident management alignment
