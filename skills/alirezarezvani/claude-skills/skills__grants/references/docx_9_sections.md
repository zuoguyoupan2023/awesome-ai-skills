# DOCX 9-Section Spec — NIH Grants Strategic Overview

This reference answers exactly one decision: **what are the 9 sections of the grants .docx, and what does each need to be useful to a researcher submitting to NIH?**

## The Core Frame

The output is a **strategic overview**, not a complete application draft. The researcher edits, copies sections into their actual application, shares with their mentor. Useful means: actionable, source-attributed, scope-aware, ready for program officer conversation.

## Section 1: Executive Summary

**Length:** Title + metadata + 3-4 bullets. Half a page.

**Contents:**
- Title: "NIH Funding Strategy: {topic}"
- Date generated
- Career stage (from Q2)
- Environment (from Q4)
- 3-4 key findings:
  - Top institute(s) funding this area (from RePORTER)
  - Top recommended mechanism (from `mechanism_matcher.py`)
  - Submission posture insight (from Q5)
  - Critical gap or opportunity (from Phase 2A positioning)

**Tone:** Confident, actionable. Reader knows what to do after this section.

## Section 2: Research Positioning

**Length:** 1-1.5 pages.

**Contents:**

### Lead with 3-5 gap quotes

Italicized, with inline Consensus citations. Example:

> *"Existing approaches to sepsis prediction rely on static risk scores that fail to capture dynamic deterioration trajectories"* (Smith et al. 2023, Consensus).

These quotes become the foundation for the Significance section of the actual application.

### Positioning narrative (2-3 paragraphs)

Draft Significance/Innovation tone:
- Paragraph 1: The field has established X (refs from "Established" facet)
- Paragraph 2: Current approaches do Y, but Z remains unanswered (refs from "Current Approaches" + "Gaps" facets)
- Paragraph 3: This proposal addresses Z via {novel approach} (anchored in Q1 research idea)

### Supporting evidence table

| Finding | Source | Year | Cites |
|---|---|---|---|
| ... | Smith et al. | 2023 | 47 |

## Section 3: Target Institutes

**Length:** Half page.

### Ranking table

| Rank | Institute | Projects in window | % of total | Mission alignment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | NHLBI | 23 | 38% | High — cardiovascular focus matches |
| 2 | NIDDK | 14 | 23% | Medium — metabolic angle |
| 3 | NCI | 8 | 13% | Low — oncology adjacent |

### 2-3 sentence interpretation

> NHLBI dominates this funding area with 38% of projects in the recent 4-year window. Their mission specifically prioritizes... If your Q1 hypothesis maps to cardiovascular outcomes, NHLBI is the primary target. NIDDK is a viable secondary if metabolic outcomes are involved.

## Section 4: Grant Opportunities

**Length:** 1 page.

### NOSI callout (if any found)

Bold amber box:

> 🔶 **Active NOSI: NOT-HL-25-014** — Special interest in machine learning for cardiovascular risk prediction. Expires: 2027-09-30. URL: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HL-25-014.html
>
> If your project fits this NOSI, your application is reviewed with knowledge of the institute's specific interest in this area — substantially increases prospects.

### Top 3 grants table

| FOA | Mechanism | Institute | Deadline | Budget | Hyperlink |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PAR-25-XXX | R01 | NHLBI | Feb 5 | $499k × 5 yr | [link to PA] |
| PA-25-YYY | R21 | NHLBI | Jun 16 | $275k × 2 yr | [link] |
| RFA-HL-25-ZZZ | U01 | NHLBI | Oct 5 | varies | [link] |

### Per-grant paragraph

For each: scope/budget fit. Whether the user's career stage + prelim + environment align with this specific FOA.

## Section 5: Funded Overlap

**Length:** 1 page.

### Top 5 funded projects table

| PI | Project | IC | Year | Hyperlink |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Smith, J. | "AI-driven sepsis prediction..." | NHLBI | 2024 | [RePORTER] |

### Differentiation paragraph

> The closest existing project is Smith et al. (Project #R01HL12345) at Johns Hopkins. They focus on adult ICU patients with sepsis. **Your differentiation:** pediatric population, prospective trial design, real-time deployment vs retrospective benchmarking.

This differentiation paragraph is what the reviewer reads BEFORE the Approach section. Make it sharp.

## Section 6: Study Sections

**Length:** Half page.

### Ranking table

| Rank | Study Section | Projects in window | Specialization |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | MEDS (Medical Imaging Study Section) | 12 | Imaging/AI methods |
| 2 | BMIO (Bioinformatics Methods + ML) | 8 | Methods development |

### Best-match interpretation

> MEDS reviews most similar applications. Implications: lean into methods rigor (their reviewers will know the methodology landscape); abstract should make method specifically clear; supplementary methods section should be detailed.

## Section 7: Strategic Recommendations & Next Steps

**Length:** 1-1.5 pages.

### 3-4 numbered recommendations

1. **Target NHLBI as primary** — strongest institute alignment + active NOSI matches your scope
2. **Apply for R21 first if Q3=pilot, R01 if Q3=strong** — scope-aware mechanism (from `mechanism_matcher.py`)
3. **Frame as ML methods + clinical application** — appeals to MEDS reviewers
4. **(If resubmission, Q5=2):** Address prior reviewer concern A by adding aim X; address concern B with prelim data Y

### MANDATORY program officer recommendation

> **Single most valuable next step: contact program officer at NHLBI.**
>
> Staff page: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/divisions → relevant division → Program Officers.
>
> Prepare:
> 1. 1-page specific aims draft
> 2. NIH biosketch
> 3. 3 specific questions about NOSI fit + mechanism preference + study section recommendation
>
> Email subject: "Pre-application inquiry: <topic>". Mention specific NOSI if applicable.

### Submission timeline note

| Mechanism | Standard receipt dates |
|---|---|
| R01, R21, R03 | Feb 5, Jun 5, Oct 5 |
| K awards | Feb 12, Jun 12, Oct 12 |
| R34, R61/R33 | Feb 16, Jun 16, Oct 16 |
| F31, F32 | Apr 8, Aug 8, Dec 8 |

Work backwards from the deadline: typical writing window is 4-6 months. Pre-application program officer contact 3-4 months before. Internal institutional pre-review 6 weeks before.

### Closing paragraph

> Your strongest path is {top recommendation}. Highest-leverage next action: contact {top institute} program officer this week with the 1-pager. They'll tell you whether to proceed with {mechanism} or pivot.

## Section 8: References

| NOT-DK-24-009 | Fetch failed | (not included) |

### Summary stats

```
Three counts:
- Queries sent:          7 (5 Consensus + 2 RePORTER)
- Results received:      120 (Consensus 50 + RePORTER 67 + NOSI 3)
- Results cited:         28 (Consensus 22 + RePORTER 5 + NOSI 1)

Failed steps: 1 (NOSI NOT-DK-24-009 fetch — included in NOSI table above)
```

### Tool constraints note

> RePORTER queried via POST (web_fetch is GET-only and would have failed silently). Consensus per-query cap detected as 10 (free tier). 3 consecutive failures threshold not reached this run.
