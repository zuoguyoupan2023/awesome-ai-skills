## Workflows

### Workflow 1: ISMS Implementation

**Step 1: Define Scope and Context**

Document organizational context and ISMS boundaries:
- Identify interested parties and requirements
- Define ISMS scope and boundaries
- Document internal/external issues

**Validation:** Scope statement reviewed and approved by management.

**Step 2: Conduct Risk Assessment**

```bash
python scripts/risk_assessment.py --scope "full-organization" --template general --output initial_risks.json
```

- Identify information assets
- Assess threats and vulnerabilities
- Calculate risk levels
- Determine risk treatment options

**Validation:** Risk register contains all critical assets with assigned owners.

**Step 3: Select and Implement Controls**

Map risks to ISO 27002 controls:

```bash
python scripts/compliance_checker.py --standard iso27002 --gap-analysis --output control_gaps.md
```

Control categories:
- Organizational (policies, roles, responsibilities)
- People (screening, awareness, training)
- Physical (perimeters, equipment, media)
- Technological (access, crypto, network, application)

**Validation:** Statement of Applicability (SoA) documents all controls with justification.

**Step 4: Establish Monitoring**

Define security metrics:
- Incident count and severity trends
- Control effectiveness scores
- Training completion rates
- Audit findings closure rate

**Validation:** Dashboard shows real-time compliance status.

### Workflow 2: Security Risk Assessment

**Step 1: Asset Identification**

Create asset inventory:

| Asset Type | Examples | Classification |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| Information | Patient records, source code | Confidential |
| Software | EHR system, APIs | Critical |
| Hardware | Servers, medical devices | High |
| Services | Cloud hosting, backup | High |
| People | Admin accounts, developers | Varies |

**Validation:** All assets have assigned owners and classifications.

**Step 2: Threat Analysis**

Identify threats per asset category:

| Asset | Threats | Likelihood |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Patient data | Unauthorized access, breach | High |
| Medical devices | Malware, tampering | Medium |
| Cloud services | Misconfiguration, outage | Medium |
| Credentials | Phishing, brute force | High |

**Validation:** Threat model covers top-10 industry threats.

**Step 3: Vulnerability Assessment**

```bash
python scripts/risk_assessment.py --scope "network-infrastructure" --output vuln_risks.json
```

Document vulnerabilities:
- Technical (unpatched systems, weak configs)
- Process (missing procedures, gaps)
- People (lack of training, insider risk)

**Validation:** Vulnerability scan results mapped to risk register.

**Step 4: Risk Evaluation and Treatment**

Calculate risk: `Risk = Likelihood × Impact`

| Risk Level | Score | Treatment |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| Critical | 20-25 | Immediate action required |
| High | 15-19 | Treatment plan within 30 days |
| Medium | 10-14 | Treatment plan within 90 days |
| Low | 5-9 | Accept or monitor |
| Minimal | 1-4 | Accept |

**Validation:** All high/critical risks have approved treatment plans.

### Workflow 3: Incident Response

**Step 1: Detection and Reporting**

Incident categories:
- Security breach (unauthorized access)
- Malware infection
- Data leakage
- System compromise
- Policy violation

**Validation:** Incident logged within 15 minutes of detection.

**Step 2: Triage and Classification**

| Severity | Criteria | Response Time |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Critical | Data breach, system down | Immediate |
| High | Active threat, significant risk | 1 hour |
| Medium | Contained threat, limited impact | 4 hours |
| Low | Minor violation, no impact | 24 hours |

**Validation:** Severity assigned and escalation triggered if needed.

**Step 3: Containment and Eradication**

Immediate actions:
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Preserve evidence
3. Block threat vectors
4. Remove malicious artifacts

**Validation:** Containment confirmed, no ongoing compromise.

**Step 4: Recovery and Lessons Learned**

Post-incident activities:
1. Restore systems from clean backups
2. Verify integrity before reconnection
3. Document timeline and actions
4. Conduct post-incident review
5. Update controls and procedures

**Validation:** Post-incident report completed within 5 business days.

- [ ] Information security policy published
- [ ] Risk assessment completed
- [ ] Statement of Applicability finalized
- [ ] Internal audit conducted
- [ ] Management review completed
- [ ] Nonconformities addressed

Before Stage 2 audit:
- [ ] Controls implemented and operational
- [ ] Evidence of effectiveness available
- [ ] Staff trained and aware

## Worked Example: Healthcare Risk Assessment

**Scenario:** Assess security risks for a patient data management system.

### Step 1: Define Assets

```bash
python scripts/risk_assessment.py --scope "patient-data-system" --template healthcare
```

**Asset inventory output:**

| Asset ID | Asset | Type | Owner | Classification |
|----------|-------|------|-------|----------------|
| A001 | Patient database | Information | DBA Team | Confidential |
| A002 | EHR application | Software | App Team | Critical |
| A003 | Database server | Hardware | Infra Team | High |
| A004 | Admin credentials | Access | Security | Critical |

### Step 2: Identify Risks

**Risk register output:**

| Risk ID | Asset | Threat | Vulnerability | L | I | Score |
|---------|-------|--------|---------------|---|---|-------|
| R001 | A001 | Data breach | Weak encryption | 3 | 5 | 15 |
| R002 | A002 | SQL injection | Input validation | 4 | 4 | 16 |
| R003 | A004 | Credential theft | No MFA | 4 | 5 | 20 |

### Step 3: Determine Treatment

| Risk | Treatment | Control | Timeline |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| R001 | Mitigate | Implement AES-256 encryption | 30 days |
| R002 | Mitigate | Add input validation, WAF | 14 days |
| R003 | Mitigate | Enforce MFA for all admins | 7 days |

### Step 4: Verify Implementation

```bash
python scripts/compliance_checker.py --controls-file implemented_controls.csv
```

**Verification output:**

```
Control Implementation Status
=============================
Cryptography (A.8.24): IMPLEMENTED
