# /cs:iso27001-audit-prep — ISO 27001 ISMS Audit Forcing Questions

**Command:** `/cs:iso27001-audit-prep <scope>`

The ISO 27001 ISMS auditor pressure-tests any ISMS work. Six sample-driven questions before any internal audit, stage 1 readiness, or surveillance audit.

## When to Run

- Before annual Clause 9.2 internal audit
- Before stage 1 / stage 2 ISO 27001 certification audit
- Before surveillance audit (year 2 / year 3)
- After material change to ISMS scope (new business unit, new product line, new SaaS adoption)
- Post-incident (breach triggers ad-hoc ISMS audit)
- Quarterly during high-growth phase

## The Six ISMS Questions

### 1. What's the audit scope, and is rolling 3-year coverage on track?
**No 3-year coverage discipline, no defensible programme.**
- Every Clause 4-10 + every applicable Annex A control must be audited at least once per 3-year cycle
- Run `isms_audit_scheduler.py` in `ra-qm-team/skills/isms-audit-expert/`
- Confirm auditor independence — no self-audit on any sample

### 2. When was the risk register last refreshed, and are treatments linked to Annex A controls?
**Stale risk register = certification finding.**
- Quarterly refresh expected; annual minimum
- Every high/critical risk must link to ≥ 1 Annex A control treating it
- Residual risk acceptance documented + signed
- Review against `iso27001_audit_playbook.md` for stage 1 expectations

### 3. Show me the access review records — quarterly cadence, the last 4 quarters.
**Most-cited finding area.**
- Annex A.5.15 + A.8.2 + A.8.3 access controls
- Sample real records pulled from Okta / IAM, not curated audit-prep packs
- For each terminated employee in last 90 days: deprovisioning evidence within 24-hour SLA
- Privileged access reviewed at finer granularity

### 4. What's the supplier inventory + last review evidence?
**Second-most-cited finding area.**
- Annex A.5.19-A.5.21 supplier management
- Critical SaaS suppliers reviewed at least annually
- DPAs signed for personal-data sub-processors (cross-check with cs-dpo-gdpr)
- AI-specific contract clauses where third-party AI services in use (cross-check with cs-aims-iso42001)

### 5. Where's the incident response evidence + post-incident review?
**A.5.24-27 + A.6.8 — high-stakes audit area.**
- Severity definitions documented + consistently applied
- Last 5 incidents have post-incident review (PIR) within 30-day SLA
- GDPR Article 33 / 34 notification timing aligned with A.5.24 (cross-check with cs-dpo-gdpr)
- Blameless retro culture; not punitive

### 6. What's the management review cadence + inputs?
**Clause 9.3 required inputs are prescriptive — easy to miss.**
- Required inputs: audit results, risks, performance, nonconformities, opportunities
- Schedule: annual minimum; quarterly preferred for mature programs
- Outputs documented + tracked to closure
- Integrated review across frameworks (per `multi_framework_audit_playbook.md`) preferred to separate reviews

## Workflow

```bash
# 1. Audit programme planning
python ../../ra-qm-team/skills/isms-audit-expert/scripts/isms_audit_scheduler.py audit_scope.json

# 2. Mock audit for readiness check
python ../../skills/compliance-os/scripts/audit_simulator.py iso27001_scope.json

# 3. Cross-framework reuse (SOC 2 = 75% overlap; ISO 42001 = 60% reuse)
python ../../skills/compliance-os/scripts/cross_framework_mapper.py program.json
```
