## Proactive Triggers

- **Over-relying on one channel** → Single-channel dependency is a business risk. Diversify.
- **No lead scoring** → Not all leads are equal. Route to revenue-operations for scoring.
- **CAC exceeding LTV** → Demand gen is unprofitable. Optimize or cut channels.
- **No nurture for non-ready leads** → 80% of leads aren't ready to buy. Nurture converts them later.
