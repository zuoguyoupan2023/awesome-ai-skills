# Marketing Skills Division

42 production-ready marketing skills organized into 7 specialist pods with a context foundation and orchestration layer.

## Quick Start

### Claude Code
```
/read marketing-skill/marketing-ops/SKILL.md
```
The router will direct you to the right specialist skill.

### Codex CLI
```bash
codex --full-auto "Read marketing-skill/marketing-ops/SKILL.md, then help me write a blog post about [topic]"
```

### OpenClaw
Skills are auto-discovered from the repository. Ask your agent for marketing help — it routes via `marketing-ops`.
