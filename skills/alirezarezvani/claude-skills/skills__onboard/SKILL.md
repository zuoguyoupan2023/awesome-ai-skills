# /cs:onboard — Founder Interview

**Command:** `/cs:onboard`

The first command to run when adopting c-level-agents. A structured founder interview that produces `~/.claude/company-context.md` — the file every cs-* advisor reads before responding. Without this, the advisors are guessing.

## What This Produces

`~/.claude/company-context.md` — a single file with the durable facts about the company. Read by:
- `cs-chief-of-staff` (routing decisions)
- Every cs-* advisor (context for any question)
- `/cs:brief` (assumptions in any new decision)

## The Interview (12 Questions)

### Company Basics
1. **Company name and one-sentence pitch.**
2. **Stage:** pre-seed / seed / Series A / Series B / Series C+ / public
3. **Headcount:** total, by function (eng / product / GTM / ops / G&A)
4. **Geographic distribution:** HQ + remote split, key countries

### Business Model
5. **Revenue model:** SaaS subscription / usage / transaction / marketplace / hardware / services
6. **ICP:** name one real customer and describe what they have in common with others
7. **ACV:** median and range; deal count last 12 months
8. **Growth rate:** ARR YoY; if pre-revenue, leading metric (users, MAU, etc.)

### Financial Posture
9. **Runway:** months of cash at current burn; bear-case months
10. **Last raise:** amount, valuation, lead investor, date

### Strategic Context
11. **Top 3 priorities for the current quarter** (in plain language)
12. **Top 3 risks the founder loses sleep over** (be specific)

## Routing Hints
[Optional: any role the founder wants to use sparingly or rely on heavily]
```

## Workflow

1. Walk the founder through all 12 questions
2. Quote founder's own words wherever possible (don't paraphrase the ICP)
3. Save to `~/.claude/company-context.md`
4. (Optional) If llm-wiki bridge is configured: symlink to vault
   ```bash
   ln -sf ~/company-vault/00-meta/company-context.md ~/.claude/company-context.md
   ```
5. Confirm with founder: read the file back, ask "anything missing?"

## When to Re-Run

- After a fundraise (numbers change)
- After a major pivot or product launch
- After 6+ months (most facts have drifted)
- After a major hire (team distribution changes)
- Always before a `/cs:boardroom` for a high-stakes decision

## Persistence

By default, `~/.claude/company-context.md` is local to the founder's machine. To make it persistent across machines / shareable:

- **Markdown vault (recommended):** see [`../../references/llm-wiki-bridge.md`](../../references/llm-wiki-bridge.md)
- **Encrypted dotfile sync:** age + git
- **Shared team:** keep in a private repo, symlink from `~/.claude/`
