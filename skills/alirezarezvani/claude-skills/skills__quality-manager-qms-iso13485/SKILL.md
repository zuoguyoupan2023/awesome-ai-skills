## QMS Implementation Workflow

Implement ISO 13485:2016 compliant quality management system from gap analysis through certification.

### Workflow: Initial QMS Implementation

1. Conduct gap analysis against ISO 13485:2016 requirements
2. Document current state vs. required state for each clause
3. Prioritize gaps by:
   - Regulatory criticality
   - Risk to product safety
   - Resource requirements
4. Develop implementation roadmap with milestones
5. Establish Quality Manual per Clause 4.2.2:
   - QMS scope with justified exclusions
   - Process interactions
   - Procedure references
6. Create required documented procedures — see [Mandatory Documented Procedures](#quick-reference-mandatory-documented-procedures) for the full list
7. Deploy processes with training
8. **Validation:** Gap analysis complete; Quality Manual approved; all required procedures documented and trained

> Use the Gap Analysis Matrix template in [qms-process-templates.md](references/qms-process-templates.md) to document clause-by-clause current state, gaps, priority, and actions.

### QMS Structure

| Level | Document Type | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | Quality Manual | QM-001 |
| 2 | Procedures | SOP-02-001 |
| 3 | Work Instructions | WI-06-012 |
| 4 | Records | Training records |

---

## Document Control Workflow

Establish and maintain document control per ISO 13485 Clause 4.2.3.

### Workflow: Document Creation and Approval

1. Identify need for new document or revision
2. Assign document number per numbering convention:
   - Format: `[TYPE]-[AREA]-[SEQUENCE]-[REV]`
   - Example: `SOP-02-001-01`
3. Draft document using approved template
4. Route for review to subject matter experts
5. Collect and address review comments
6. Obtain required approvals based on document type
7. Update Document Master List
8. **Validation:** Document numbered correctly; all reviewers signed; Master List updated

### Document Numbering Convention

| Prefix | Document Type | Approval Authority |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| QM | Quality Manual | Management Rep + CEO |
| POL | Policy | Department Head + QA |
| SOP | Procedure | Process Owner + QA |
| WI | Work Instruction | Supervisor + QA |

---

## Internal Audit Workflow

Plan and execute internal audits per ISO 13485 Clause 8.2.4.

### Workflow: Annual Audit Program

1. Identify processes and areas requiring audit coverage
2. Assess risk factors for audit frequency:
   - Previous audit findings
   - Regulatory changes
   - Process changes
   - Complaint trends
3. Assign qualified auditors (independent of area audited)
4. Develop annual audit schedule
5. Obtain management approval
6. Communicate schedule to process owners
7. Track completion and reschedule as needed
8. **Validation:** All processes covered; auditors qualified and independent; schedule approved

> Use the Audit Program Template in [qms-process-templates.md](references/qms-process-templates.md) to schedule audits by clause and quarter across processes such as Document Control (4.2.3/4.2.4), Management Review (5.6), Design Control (7.3), Production (7.5), and CAPA (8.5.2/8.5.3).

### Workflow: Individual Audit Execution

1. Prepare audit plan with scope, criteria, and schedule
2. Notify auditee minimum 1 week prior
3. Review procedures and previous audit results
4. Prepare audit checklist
5. Conduct opening meeting
6. Collect evidence through:
   - Document review
   - Record sampling
   - Process observation
   - Personnel interviews
7. Classify findings:
   - Major NC: Absence or breakdown of system
   - Minor NC: Single lapse or deviation
   - Observation: Risk of future NC
8. Conduct closing meeting
9. Issue audit report within 5 business days
10. **Validation:** All checklist items addressed; findings supported by evidence; report distributed

### Auditor Qualification Requirements

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Training | ISO 13485 awareness + auditor training |
| Experience | Minimum 1 audit as observer |
| Independence | Not auditing own work area |
| Competence | Understanding of audited process |

### Finding Classification Guide

| Classification | Criteria | Response Time |
|----------------|----------|---------------|
| Major NC | System absence, total breakdown, regulatory violation | 30 days for CAPA |
| Minor NC | Single instance, partial compliance | 60 days for CAPA |
| Observation | Potential risk, improvement opportunity | Track in next audit |

## Process Validation Workflow

Validate special processes per ISO 13485 Clause 7.5.6.

### Workflow: Process Validation Protocol

1. Identify processes requiring validation:
   - Output cannot be verified by inspection
   - Deficiencies appear only in use
   - Sterilization, welding, sealing, software
2. Form validation team with subject matter experts
3. Write validation protocol including:
   - Process description and parameters
   - Equipment and materials
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Statistical approach
4. Execute IQ: verify equipment installed correctly and document specifications
5. Execute OQ: test parameter ranges and verify process control
6. Execute PQ: run production conditions and verify output meets requirements
7. Write validation report with conclusions
8. **Validation:** IQ/OQ/PQ complete; acceptance criteria met; validation report approved

### Validation Documentation Requirements

| Phase | Content | Evidence |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Protocol | Objectives, methods, criteria | Approved protocol |
| IQ | Equipment verification | Installation records |
| OQ | Parameter verification | Test results |
| PQ | Performance verification | Production data |
| Report | Summary, conclusions | Approval signatures |

### Revalidation Triggers

| Trigger | Action Required |
|---------|-----------------|
| Equipment change | Assess impact, revalidate affected phases |
| Parameter change | OQ and PQ minimum |
| Material change | Assess impact, PQ minimum |
| Process failure | Full revalidation |
| Periodic | Per validation schedule (typically 3 years) |

### Special Process Examples

| Process | Validation Standard | Critical Parameters |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|
| EO Sterilization | ISO 11135 | Temperature, humidity, EO concentration, time |
| Steam Sterilization | ISO 17665 | Temperature, pressure, time |
| Radiation Sterilization | ISO 11137 | Dose, dose uniformity |
| Sealing | Internal | Temperature, pressure, dwell time |
| Welding | ISO 11607 | Heat, pressure, speed |

## Supplier Qualification Workflow

Evaluate and approve suppliers per ISO 13485 Clause 7.4.

### Workflow: New Supplier Qualification

1. Identify supplier category:
   - Category A: Critical (affects safety/performance)
   - Category B: Major (affects quality)
   - Category C: Minor (indirect impact)
2. Request supplier information:
   - Quality certifications
   - Product specifications
   - Quality history
3. Evaluate supplier based on:
   - Quality system (ISO certification)
   - Technical capability
   - Quality history
   - Financial stability
4. For Category A suppliers:
   - Conduct on-site audit
   - Require quality agreement
5. Calculate qualification score
6. Make approval decision:
   - >80: Approved
   - 60-80: Conditional approval
   - <60: Not approved
7. Add to Approved Supplier List
8. **Validation:** Evaluation criteria scored; qualification records complete; supplier categorized

### Supplier Evaluation Criteria

|----------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| A - Critical | On-site audit | Annual review | Quality agreement |
| B - Major | Questionnaire | Semi-annual review | Quality requirements |
| C - Minor | Assessment | Issue-based | Standard terms |

### Supplier Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Calculation |
