## Risk Analysis Workflow

Identify hazards and estimate risks systematically.

### Workflow: Conduct Risk Analysis

1. Define intended use and reasonably foreseeable misuse:
   - Medical indication
   - Patient population
   - User population
   - Use environment
2. Select analysis method(s):
   - FMEA for component/function analysis
   - FTA for system-level analysis
   - HAZOP for process deviations
   - Use Error Analysis for user interaction
3. Identify hazards by category:
   - Energy hazards (electrical, mechanical, thermal)
   - Biological hazards (bioburden, biocompatibility)
   - Chemical hazards (residues, leachables)
   - Operational hazards (software, use errors)
4. Determine hazardous situations:
   - Sequence of events
   - Foreseeable misuse scenarios
   - Single fault conditions
5. Estimate probability of harm (P1-P5)
6. Estimate severity of harm (S1-S5)
7. Document in hazard analysis worksheet
8. **Validation:** All hazard categories addressed; all hazards documented; probability and severity assigned

## Risk Evaluation Workflow

Evaluate risks against acceptability criteria.

### Workflow: Evaluate Identified Risks

1. Calculate initial risk level from probability × severity
2. Compare to risk acceptability criteria
3. For each risk, determine:
   - Acceptable: Document and accept
   - ALARP: Proceed to risk control
   - Unacceptable: Mandatory risk control
4. Document evaluation rationale
5. Identify risks requiring benefit-risk analysis
6. Complete benefit-risk analysis if applicable
7. Compile risk evaluation summary
8. **Validation:** All risks evaluated; acceptability determined; rationale documented

### Risk Evaluation Decision Tree

```
Risk Estimated
      │
      ▼
Apply Acceptability Criteria
      │
      ├── Low Risk ──────────► Accept and document
      │
      ├── Medium Risk ───────► Consider risk reduction
      │   │                    Document ALARP if not reduced
      │   ▼
      │   Practicable to reduce?
      │   │
      │   Yes──► Implement control
      │   No───► Document ALARP rationale
      │
      ├── High Risk ─────────► Risk reduction required
      │   │                    Must demonstrate ALARP
      │   ▼
      │   Implement control
      │   Verify residual risk
      │
      └── Unacceptable ──────► Design change mandatory
                               Cannot proceed without control
```

### ALARP Demonstration Requirements

| Criterion | Evidence Required |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Technical feasibility | Analysis of alternative controls |
| Proportionality | Cost-benefit of further reduction |
| State of the art | Comparison to similar devices |
| Stakeholder input | Clinical/user perspectives |

### Benefit-Risk Analysis Triggers

| Situation | Benefit-Risk Required |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Residual risk remains high | Yes |
| No feasible risk reduction | Yes |
| Novel device | Yes |
| Unacceptable risk with clinical benefit | Yes |
| All risks low | No |

## Risk Control Workflow

Implement and verify risk control measures.

### Workflow: Implement Risk Controls

1. Identify risk control options:
   - Inherent safety by design (Priority 1)
   - Protective measures in device (Priority 2)
   - Information for safety (Priority 3)
2. Select optimal control following hierarchy
3. Analyze control for new hazards introduced
4. Document control in design requirements
5. Implement control in design
6. Develop verification protocol
7. Execute verification and document results
8. Evaluate residual risk with control in place
9. **Validation:** Control implemented; verification passed; residual risk acceptable; no unaddressed new hazards

### Risk Control Hierarchy

| Priority | Control Type | Examples | Effectiveness |
|----------|--------------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | Inherent Safety | Eliminate hazard, fail-safe design | Highest |
| 2 | Protective Measures | Guards, alarms, automatic shutdown | High |
| 3 | Information | Warnings, training, IFU | Lower |

```

### New Hazard Analysis

|----------|--------|-------|
| Does control introduce new hazard? | Analyze new hazard | Proceed |
| Is new risk higher than original? | Reject control option | Acceptable trade-off |
| Can new hazard be controlled? | Add control | Reject control option |

### Risk Acceptability Decision

| Condition | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| All risks Low | Acceptable |
| Medium risks with ALARP | Acceptable |
| High risks with ALARP documented | Acceptable if benefits outweigh |
| Any Unacceptable residual | Not acceptable - redesign |
