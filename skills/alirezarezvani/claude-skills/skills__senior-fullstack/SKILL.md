## Tools

### Decision Engine

Deterministic profile picker. Given four assumptions (team-size, cadence, user-facing, budget) plus optional traffic/sensitivity inputs, ranks the four built-in profiles and returns the matched profile with SLO floor and named approver chain. Refuses to recommend a profile without the four required inputs.

**Usage:**

```bash
# See all options
python scripts/fullstack_decision_engine.py --help

# Run against a sample input
python scripts/fullstack_decision_engine.py --sample

# Pick a profile from real inputs
python scripts/fullstack_decision_engine.py \
    --team-size-12mo 8 --cadence daily --user-facing true --budget 5000 \
    --traffic-p99-rps 50 --data-sensitivity pii-only

# JSON output for downstream tools
python scripts/fullstack_decision_engine.py --sample --output json
```

Returns: matched profile name, score, matched/violated constraints, stack recommendation, anti-recommendations, SLO floor, named-approver chain, and canon references.

The engine encodes the same matrix the conversational grill walks through — use it directly when inputs are already known, or via the `cs-fullstack-engineer` agent for the question-by-question grill.

- Test coverage estimation
- Documentation quality

**Usage:**

```bash
# Analyze current directory
python scripts/code_quality_analyzer.py .

# Analyze specific project
python scripts/code_quality_analyzer.py /path/to/project

# Verbose output with detailed findings
python scripts/code_quality_analyzer.py . --verbose

# JSON output
python scripts/code_quality_analyzer.py . --json

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Start New Project

1. Choose appropriate stack based on requirements (see Stack Decision Matrix)
2. Scaffold project structure
3. Verify scaffold: confirm `package.json` (or `requirements.txt`) exists
4. Run initial quality check — address any P0 issues before proceeding
5. Set up development environment

```bash
# 1. Scaffold project
python scripts/project_scaffolder.py nextjs my-saas-app

# 2. Verify scaffold succeeded
ls my-saas-app/package.json

# 3. Navigate and install
cd my-saas-app
npm install

# 4. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local

# 5. Run quality check
python ../scripts/code_quality_analyzer.py .

# 6. Start development
npm run dev
```

### Workflow 2: Audit Existing Codebase

1. Run code quality analysis
2. Review security findings — fix all P0 (critical) issues immediately
3. Re-run analyzer to confirm P0 issues are resolved
4. Create tickets for P1/P2 issues

```bash
# 1. Full analysis
python scripts/code_quality_analyzer.py /path/to/project --verbose

# 2. Generate detailed report
python scripts/code_quality_analyzer.py /path/to/project --json --output audit.json

# 3. After fixing P0 issues, re-run to verify
python scripts/code_quality_analyzer.py /path/to/project --verbose
```

### Workflow 3: Stack Selection

Use the tech stack guide to evaluate options:

1. **SEO Required?** → Next.js with SSR
2. **API-heavy backend?** → Separate FastAPI or NestJS
3. **Real-time features?** → Add WebSocket layer
4. **Team expertise** → Match stack to team skills

See `references/tech_stack_guide.md` for detailed comparison.

## Assumptions and Verifiable Success Criteria (Karpathy discipline)

Before this skill scaffolds, recommends, or modifies any code, the following four assumptions MUST be surfaced. If any are unknown, the skill stops and walks the [Forcing-question library](#forcing-question-library-matt-pocock-grill) instead.

1. **Team size today + 12-month headcount** — drives architecture (monolith / modular / services). Sam Newman: "MonolithFirst."
2. **Deployment cadence target** — drives CI/CD spend and feature-flag investment. *Accelerate* (Forsgren et al. 2018).
3. **User-facing vs. internal vs. marketing-site** — drives stack pick and a11y/perf budget.
4. **Monthly cloud + SaaS budget ceiling** — drives the build-vs-managed-service split.

**Verifiable success criteria** (Karpathy #4) — every recommendation this skill emits must include three machine-checkable numbers:

- An API latency target (p50, p95, p99 in ms)
- A frontend perf target (LCP, INP, CLS on mobile-4G)
- An uptime / SLO target

If any of those three is not stated, the recommendation is incomplete — go back to Q7 of the forcing-question library.

The `scripts/fullstack_decision_engine.py` tool encodes these checks: it refuses to recommend a profile without all four assumption inputs and prints the verifiable thresholds for the matched profile.

---

## Customization profiles

Four built-in profiles in `profiles/` calibrate every recommendation:

| Profile | When to pick | Cloud ceiling | Pattern |
|---|---|---|---|
| `saas-startup` | < 10 eng, customer-facing, daily+ cadence | $8K/mo | Modular monolith on Next.js + Postgres |
| `enterprise-scale` | 50+ eng, regulated, per-PR with gates | $250K/mo | Domain-bounded services + platform team |
| `internal-tool` | ≤ 5 eng, auth-walled, < 100 DAU | $500/mo | Retool-first; thin custom stack if forced |
| `marketing-site` | SEO-dependent, near-zero write | $200/mo | Static-first (Astro / 11ty / Next-static) |

Pick a profile via:

```bash
python scripts/fullstack_decision_engine.py \
  --team-size 6 --team-size-12mo 12 \
  --cadence daily --user-facing true --budget 5000 \
  --traffic-p99-rps 45 --data-sensitivity pii-only
```

The tool returns the best-fit profile, the tradeoff against the runner-up (if within 15%), the stack recommendation, the anti-patterns to avoid on that profile, and the named-approver chain. **This tool never auto-approves.**

To add a custom profile: copy `profiles/saas-startup.json` to `profiles/<your-org>.json`, adjust the `constraints` and `stack_recommendations` blocks, and rerun. The JSON is the customization surface — no code changes needed.

## Composition map

This skill does NOT reimplement scope owned by the POWERFUL-tier specialists. It forks into them. See `references/composition_map.md` for the full routing table. Key forks:

| Concern | Fork into |
|---|---|
| API contract review | `engineering/skills/api-design-reviewer/` |
| Database schema design | `engineering/skills/database-designer/` |
| Reliability / SLO design | `engineering/slo-architect/` |
| CI/CD pipeline | `engineering/skills/ci-cd-pipeline-builder/` |
| Performance profiling | `engineering/skills/performance-profiler/` |
| Pre-commit Karpathy review | `engineering/karpathy-coder/` |
| Pre-flight architecture grill | `engineering/grill-me/` |

The `cs-fullstack-engineer` agent (in `agents/engineering/cs-fullstack-engineer.md`) orchestrates these forks via `context: fork`. Invoke it from another agent with `Agent({subagent_type: "cs-fullstack-engineer", prompt: "..."})` or via the slash command `/cs:fullstack-review <your problem>`.

---

## Forcing-question library (Matt Pocock grill)

Before locking any architecture or stack decision, walk the seven forcing questions in `references/forcing_questions.md`. Each has a recommended answer, canon citation, and kill criterion. The discipline:

1. One question per turn. No bundling.
2. Always recommend the answer with cited canon.
3. Track answers in a working file (e.g., `/tmp/fullstack-grill-<date>.md`).
4. If a kill criterion trips, stop. Do not scaffold around an unresolved gap.
5. After Q7, run `fullstack_decision_engine.py` with the seven answers as inputs.

Summary of the seven questions (full content in the reference):

1. Team size today + 12-month headcount?
2. Deployment cadence — per-PR, daily, weekly, quarterly?
3. Customer-facing, internal tool, or marketing site?
4. One-year p50 / p99 traffic forecast?
5. Hiring against the stack or training the team?
6. Year-one monthly cloud + SaaS ceiling?
7. Three verifiable success criteria with numeric targets?

## Invocation from other agents and skills

This skill is invokable by any other agent or skill via three surfaces:

1. **Slash command:** `/cs:fullstack-review <prompt>` — runs the full grill + decision engine + composition routing.
2. **Agent subagent:** `Agent({subagent_type: "cs-fullstack-engineer", prompt: "..."})` — forks context, returns ≤ 200-word digest.
3. **Direct tool call:** `python scripts/fullstack_decision_engine.py ...` — deterministic profile match without the conversational grill (use when inputs are already known).

See `agents/engineering/cs-fullstack-engineer.md` for the full invocation contract.
