# Chief Data Officer Advisor

Strategic data leadership for startup CDOs and founders without one. **Four decisions, no surveys:**

1. **Can we train our model on this data?** — origin × consent × use-case matrix
2. **Warehouse, lakehouse, or mesh — and what do we build vs buy?** — stage-driven architecture
3. **What is our customer data worth?** — strategic value + M&A multiplier + productization paths
4. **What data role do we hire next?** — stage-to-role map, centralize-vs-embed trigger

This skill does **not** cover tactical data engineering. For schema design, observability, query optimization, RAG, or ML platform implementation, see `engineering/database-designer/`, `engineering/observability-designer/`, `engineering/data-quality-auditor/`, `engineering/sql-database-assistant/`, `engineering/rag-architect/`, `engineering/llm-cost-optimizer/`.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Audit data sources for AI training eligibility
python scripts/ai_training_data_audit.py                              # uses embedded sample
python scripts/ai_training_data_audit.py path/to/sources.json

# Pick data architecture + build-vs-buy + sequencing
python scripts/data_product_strategy_picker.py                        # uses embedded Series A SaaS
python scripts/data_product_strategy_picker.py path/to/profile.json

# Value the customer data corpus + productization viability
python scripts/data_asset_valuator.py                                 # uses embedded B2B sample
python scripts/data_asset_valuator.py path/to/corpus.json
```

## Key Questions (ask these first)

- **What decision does this data drive?** (If none, why are we collecting it?)
- **What's the consent provenance of every source we want to train on?** (TOS-only is not the same as explicit opt-in.)
- **Who are the internal data consumers, and how many distinct domains do they span?** (Drives centralize-vs-embed and warehouse-vs-mesh.)
- **In an M&A scenario, is our data a moat or a liability?** (Customer carve-outs in MSAs can flip the answer.)
- **Are we hiring an analytics engineer or a data scientist next?** (They solve different problems; founders confuse them.)
- **Have we run an anonymization audit before any external sharing?** (k-anonymity ≥ 5 is the floor, not the ceiling.)

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. AI Training Data Rights

The 2026 question every startup is facing: **can we use customer data to train our model?**

The answer is rarely binary. It depends on three independent dimensions:

| Dimension | Values |
|---|---|
| **Origin** | 1st-party-explicit-opt-in / 1st-party-TOS-only / partner-licensed / scraped / synthetic |
| **Data class** | Anonymous aggregate / behavioral / PII / 3rd-party content / regulated (PHI, PCI, kids) |
| **Use case** | In-product personalization / fine-tune our model / train foundation model / external sharing |

Each combination produces GO / MITIGATE / NO-GO. **Run** `ai_training_data_audit.py` on a JSON inventory of sources.

See `references/ai_training_data_rights.md` for the full matrix + GDPR Art. 6 lawful basis decision tree + EU AI Act high-risk triggers.

### 2. Data Product Strategy

**Architecture choice (warehouse vs lakehouse vs mesh) is stage-driven, not preference-driven:**

- **Warehouse only** (Snowflake / BigQuery / Postgres): ≤5 data consumers, <2TB, no ML use cases
- **Lakehouse** (warehouse + object storage, often Databricks or Snowflake-with-Iceberg): 5–25 data consumers, 2TB–1PB, 1–3 ML use cases
- **Data mesh**: 25+ data consumers across 4+ domains, federated ownership culture in place

**Build vs buy is decided per layer:**

| Layer | Buy unless | Build only if |
|---|---|---|
| Storage / warehouse | Never build | (You’re a data infra company) |
| ELT / ingest | Never build | Source isn’t supported by Fivetran/Airbyte |
| Modeling (dbt) | Always build | This is your IP |
| BI / dashboards | Buy at <100 consumers | Embedded analytics for customers |
| Feature store | Defer until 3+ prod models | Then build OR buy Tecton/Hopsworks |
| ML platform | Defer until 5+ prod models | Then buy SageMaker/Vertex/Databricks |

**Run** `data_product_strategy_picker.py` for a stage-specific recommendation. See `references/data_product_strategy.md` for kill criteria per architecture and the build-vs-buy decision tree.

### 3. B2B Customer-Data-as-Asset

**The shift:** at Series B+, customer data is no longer just operational — it’s an asset that can be:
- A defensibility moat (replicating requires years of customer cohort)
- An M&A multiplier (1.2x–2x ARR uplift for strategic buyers)
- A direct revenue stream (anonymized industry benchmarks, embedding endpoints, licensing)

But it can also be a **liability**:
- 47/380 customers with MSA carve-outs makes productization legally infeasible
- Anonymization audits often reveal re-identification risk above tolerable thresholds
- Regulatory exposure increases linearly with productization (GDPR Art. 28 processors vs Art. 26 joint controllers)

**Run** `data_asset_valuator.py` with corpus characteristics to get strategic value score + productization paths + risk-adjusted value.

See `references/customer_data_as_asset.md` for the valuation framework, M&A diligence prep checklist, and contractual constraint audit pattern.

### 4. Data Team Org Evolution

**The wrong question:** "Should we hire a data scientist?"
**The right question:** "What’s the next decision we can’t make because we lack data, and what role unblocks that?"

Stage-to-role map (B2B SaaS baseline):

| Stage | First hire | Then | Then |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-seed / seed | Founder-as-analyst (SQL + spreadsheets) | — | — |
| Series A (Series A) | Analyst | Analytics engineer (dbt) | — |
| Series B | Data engineer | Senior analyst (embedded in GTM) | Data PM (if 3+ teams need data) |
| Growth | Manager of analytics | ML engineer (if model is core) | Head of Data |
| Late-stage | Head of Data → CDO | Specialized: BI, MLE, DPO | Federated owners per domain (mesh) |

**Centralize-vs-embed trigger:** when 3+ functional areas (sales, marketing, product, ops, CS) need bespoke data weekly, the central team becomes the bottleneck. Move to hub-and-spoke (central platform + embedded analysts) before that becomes a hiring crisis.

See `references/data_team_org_evolution.md`.

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: AI Training Decision (1 hour)
**Goal:** Decide whether a specific data source can train a specific use case.

```bash
# 1. Build sources.json with one entry per data source
# 2. Run the audit
python scripts/ai_training_data_audit.py sources.json
# 3. For each MITIGATE: assign owner + remediation
# 4. For each NO-GO: document the kill reason for the legal log
# 5. Cross-check with cs-general-counsel-advisor on top-3 mitigation items
# 6. Log via /cs:decide
```

### Workflow 2: Architecture Decision (1 day)
**Goal:** Pick warehouse / lakehouse / mesh and the build-vs-buy split for the next 12 months.

```bash
python scripts/data_product_strategy_picker.py profile.json
# Cross-check with cs-cto-advisor on engineering capacity
# Cross-check with cs-cfo-advisor on 3-year TCO
# Log via /cs:decide; consider /cs:freeze 90 if signing a multi-year SaaS contract
```

### Workflow 3: Data Asset Valuation for M&A Prep (3 days)
**Goal:** Value the data corpus and prepare for due diligence.

1. Inventory the corpus: size, freshness, exclusivity, customer overlap, contractual restrictions
2. Run `data_asset_valuator.py`
3. Run the M&A diligence prep checklist in `customer_data_as_asset.md`
4. Surface contractual carve-outs to cs-general-counsel-advisor for re-papering plan
5. Decide productization path (benchmark report / embedding endpoint / direct license)
6. Log via /cs:decide

### Workflow 4: Data Team Roadmap (1 week)
**Goal:** Build the next 18 months of data hires aligned to business decisions.

1. List the top 5 decisions the business can’t make today due to missing data or analysis
2. Map each decision to the role that unblocks it
3. Sequence hires (one role at a time, ramp before next)
4. Cross-check with cs-chro-advisor on comp bands and leveling
5. Identify the centralize-vs-embed trigger date
