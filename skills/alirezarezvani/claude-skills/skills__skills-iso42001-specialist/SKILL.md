# ISO/IEC 42001 AI Management System Specialist

Internal-audit-grade operating skill for ISO/IEC 42001:2023. **Three decisions, no executive AI strategy:**

1. **Where are the AIMS gaps against Clauses 4–10?** — coverage scoring per clause + remediation priority
2. **What's the AI risk register, and which controls treat each risk?** — Annex A.2–A.10 control mapping per ISO 23894 risk method
3. **What's the Clause 9.2 internal audit plan?** — 12-month schedule with scope, frequency, auditor independence checks

This skill is **NOT a chief-ai-officer-advisor replacement**. CAIO decides whether to build/buy a model and what business risk to accept. This skill operates the management-system discipline that captures those decisions in audit-ready evidence.

This skill is **NOT an EU AI Act compliance skill**. ISO 42001 is a voluntary management-system standard; EU AI Act is binding product-safety regulation. They overlap (a high-risk AI system per Article 6(2) of the AI Act typically requires the QMS in Article 17, which ISO 42001 can satisfy in part) but the artefacts differ. See `compliance-team-eu-ai-act` for Article-level conformity assessment.

This skill is **NOT a substitute for ISO 23894 + 38507**. 42001 is the management system; 23894 is the AI risk methodology that feeds Clause 6.1; 38507 is the governance lens. The `ai_risk_register_builder.py` tool implements the 23894 process; treat the references as the methodology bridge.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Decision A: AIMS gap analysis against Clauses 4-10
python scripts/aims_gap_analyzer.py                           # embedded sample (mid-stage AI SaaS)
python scripts/aims_gap_analyzer.py path/to/aims_evidence.json

# Decision B: AI risk register + Annex A control mapping
python scripts/ai_risk_register_builder.py                    # embedded 7-risk sample
python scripts/ai_risk_register_builder.py path/to/risks.json

# Decision C: Clause 9.2 internal audit 12-month plan
python scripts/aims_audit_scheduler.py                        # embedded 4-domain sample
python scripts/aims_audit_scheduler.py path/to/scope.json
```

## Key Questions (ask these first)

- **Does the AIMS scope statement (Clause 4.3) name every AI system, including embedded models and third-party AI services?** If "AI features added by our SaaS vendors" is not in scope, the AIMS is incomplete.
- **Does the AI policy (Clause 5.2) commit to lawful use AND beneficial purpose AND human oversight AND continual improvement?** Missing any of the four = nonconformity at certification.
- **Has the AI risk assessment (Clause 6.1.2) been re-run since the last material model change?** Concept drift is not a one-time event.
- **Who signs the AI impact assessment for high-impact systems (Annex A.5.4)?** If no signed accountability, the control is missing.
- **What's the internal audit cadence (Clause 9.2)?** ISO management-system standards expect ≥ once per 3-year cycle per clause; mature programs do annual.
- **Is there a documented procedure for AI incidents (Annex A.9.3)?** Untreated post-deployment monitoring is the #1 nonconformity in early adopters.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. AIMS Gap Analysis (Clauses 4–10)

**The framework:** ISO 42001 follows the Annex SL high-level structure shared with ISO 9001 / 27001 / 13485. Clauses 4–10 are the management-system requirements; Annex A controls A.1–A.10 are the AI-specific operational controls.

| Clause | What it requires | Common gap |
|---|---|---|
| **4. Context** | AI scope, interested parties, external context | Scope omits third-party AI services |
| **5. Leadership** | AI policy, roles, accountability | Policy treats "AI ethics" as marketing copy, not commitment |
| **6. Planning** | AI risk + impact assessment, objectives | Risk register doesn't link to controls |
| **7. Support** | Resources, competence, awareness, documented info | Competence requirements undefined for ML engineers |
| **8. Operation** | Operational planning, AI system lifecycle | Lifecycle stages not mapped to Annex A controls |
| **9. Performance** | Monitoring, internal audit, management review | Drift monitoring exists in code but not in management review inputs |
| **10. Improvement** | Nonconformity, corrective action, continual improvement | CAPA loop separate from existing 13485/9001 CAPA — duplication |

**Run** `aims_gap_analyzer.py` with an evidence inventory JSON to score each clause (full / partial / missing) and get a prioritized remediation list.

See `references/iso42001_clauses.md` for the full clause-by-clause walkthrough with audit evidence expectations.

### 2. AI Risk Register + Annex A Control Mapping

**The framework:** Clause 6.1.2 requires AI risk assessment; Clause 6.1.3 requires risk treatment. Annex A provides 38 controls organized into 10 control categories (A.2–A.10). The risk register must show each identified risk linked to ≥ 1 control that treats it.

**Annex A control categories (the 10):**

| ID | Category | Example controls |
|---|---|---|
| **A.2** | AI policy | A.2.2 AI policy, A.2.3 alignment with other policies |
| **A.3** | Internal organization | A.3.2 AI roles & responsibilities, A.3.3 reporting concerns |
| **A.4** | Resources for AI systems | A.4.2 data resources, A.4.3 tooling, A.4.4 human resources |
| **A.5** | Assessing impacts | A.5.2 AI system impact assessment, A.5.4 documentation of impact assessment |
| **A.6** | AI system lifecycle | A.6.2.2 objectives, A.6.2.3 lifecycle phases, A.6.2.4 verification & validation |
| **A.7** | Data for AI systems | A.7.2 data management, A.7.3 data quality, A.7.4 data provenance, A.7.5 data preparation |
| **A.8** | Information for interested parties | A.8.2 system documentation, A.8.3 user information, A.8.4 communication of incidents |
| **A.9** | Use of AI systems | A.9.2 intended use, A.9.3 monitoring of operation, A.9.4 logging of system events |
| **A.10** | Third-party & customer relationships | A.10.2 supplier relationships, A.10.3 customer relationships |

ISO/IEC 23894:2023 provides the AI-specific risk-management process (the methodology); 42001 Annex A provides the controls. The risk register is the bridge.

**Run** `ai_risk_register_builder.py` with an identified-risks JSON to produce a structured register with mapped controls + residual-risk verdict per ISO 23894 risk-treatment options.

See `references/aims_controls_annex_a.md` for the full 38-control catalogue with audit evidence per control.

### 3. Clause 9.2 Internal Audit Plan

**The framework:** Clause 9.2 requires "internal audits at planned intervals to provide information on whether the AIMS conforms to the organization's requirements and is effectively implemented and maintained." That's the management-system requirement; the **how often** and **how deep** are organizational choices.

**Mature-program defaults:**

- Cover every clause + every applicable Annex A control over a 3-year cycle (rolling)
- Annual full-system audit covering Clauses 4, 5, 9, 10 (the "always relevant" clauses)
- Quarterly or semi-annual deep dives on Clauses 6, 7, 8 by domain (per AI system or per lifecycle phase)
- Auditor independence: nobody audits their own work; A.6 lifecycle owner cannot audit Clause 8 operation

**Run** `aims_audit_scheduler.py` with a scope JSON (AI systems in scope, prior-year findings, certification cycle phase) to produce a 12-month plan with auditor assignments and independence checks.

See `references/aims_implementation_guide.md` for the maturity model and rollout sequencing (year 1 establish, year 2 certify, year 3+ continual improvement).

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: AIMS Gap Closure for Certification (4–8 weeks)
**Goal:** Identify gaps; prioritize remediation; close before stage 1 certification audit.

```bash
# 1. Inventory current AIMS evidence (policies, procedures, records)
python scripts/aims_gap_analyzer.py aims_evidence.json
# 2. Review gap matrix; group by clause
# 3. For each gap, identify owner + due date (target: close before stage 1)
# 4. Cross-check against ISO 27001 / 13485 existing artifacts — many can be reused
# 5. Cross-check against EU AI Act obligations (use compliance-team-eu-ai-act)
# 6. Output: prioritized remediation plan with owners + dates
```

### Workflow 2: AI Risk Register Build (1–2 weeks)
**Goal:** Construct the Clause 6.1.2 risk register with full Annex A control coverage.

```bash
# 1. Run ISO 23894 risk identification across AI lifecycle (data, model, deployment, decommission)
# 2. Capture each risk with: source, event, consequence, likelihood, impact
python scripts/ai_risk_register_builder.py risks.json
# 3. For each high/critical risk, confirm ≥ 1 Annex A control is selected as treatment
# 4. Document residual risk acceptance with management signoff
# 5. Cross-check with cs-caio-advisor on executive risk acceptance for "tolerate" decisions
# 6. Log via management review (Clause 9.3)
```

### Workflow 3: Annual Internal Audit Plan (1 day)
**Goal:** Produce the 12-month Clause 9.2 plan with auditor independence.

```bash
# 1. Pull last year's audit findings and certification cycle status (year 1/2/3)
python scripts/aims_audit_scheduler.py audit_scope.json
# 2. Confirm auditor independence per assignment
# 3. Confirm coverage hits every clause and every applicable Annex A control over rolling 3 years
# 4. Submit plan for management review approval (Clause 9.3 input)
```

### Workflow 4: Cross-Framework Reuse Mapping (per system onboarded)
**Goal:** When adding a new AI system, map ISO 42001 evidence against existing 27001 + 13485 evidence to avoid duplication.

1. Pull existing ISO 27001 Annex A controls + ISO 13485 procedures relevant to the system
2. For each ISO 42001 Annex A control, identify whether an existing artifact already satisfies it (e.g., 27001 A.8.16 monitoring activities can extend to AI system monitoring)
3. Add the AI-specific overlay only where the existing control doesn't cover it
4. Document mapping in the AIMS scope statement (Clause 4.3)

## Output Standards

```
**Bottom Line:** [one sentence — gap severity + the one thing to close first]
**The Decision:** [one of: gap-closure | risk-treatment | audit-scope]
**The Evidence:** [clause numbers + control IDs from the tool, not adjectives]
**How to Act:** [3 concrete next steps with owners + dates]
**Your Decision:** [the call only the compliance officer or CAIO can make — risk acceptance, scope expansion, certification readiness]
```
