# VP of Engineering Advisor

Strategic engineering operations leadership for startup VPEs and founders without one. **Four decisions, no generic engineering survey:**

1. **Are we delivering at the right throughput?** — DORA 4 metrics + bottleneck identification (where work waits)
2. **How do we scale the eng hiring funnel?** — funnel math + pipeline gap + time-to-fill discipline
3. **What's our team structure — and when do we add a tech-lead manager?** — squad/tribe/chapter design + manager-trigger
4. **What's our production discipline?** — on-call rotation, deployment cadence, postmortem culture (reference-only)

This skill is **NOT a CTO skill**. CTO owns *what to build* (architecture, scaling cliffs, build-vs-buy). VPE owns *how to ship it reliably* (delivery, hiring, team structure, production operations). At early stage these are often the same person; at scale they're distinct roles.

This skill is **NOT a cs-engineering-lead replacement**. Engineering-lead owns day-to-day incident and on-call coordination. VPE owns the operating model that engineering-lead executes.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Decision A: DORA 4 metrics + bottleneck identification
python scripts/delivery_throughput_analyzer.py                          # embedded sprint sample
python scripts/delivery_throughput_analyzer.py path/to/sprint_metrics.json

# Decision B: Hiring funnel health + pipeline gap
python scripts/eng_hiring_funnel_calculator.py                          # embedded 3-quarter sample
python scripts/eng_hiring_funnel_calculator.py path/to/funnel.json

# Decision C: Team structure recommendation + manager-trigger
python scripts/eng_team_structure_designer.py                           # embedded 25-engineer sample
python scripts/eng_team_structure_designer.py path/to/team.json
```

## Key Questions (ask these first)

- **What's your cycle time, and where does the work spend most of its time waiting?** (If you don't know, you can't improve it.)
- **How long from commit to production?** (DORA "lead time for changes" — best predictor of overall team health.)
- **What's the escape rate?** (Bugs found in production vs caught in CI/staging. > 15% = quality discipline broken.)
- **When did the eng manager last write code?** (Manager-IC ratio is wrong if managers can't review code at all.)
- **What's the hiring funnel conversion at each stage?** (Source → screen → onsite → offer → accept. The leakage is the answer.)
- **What's the on-call rotation, and who's on it?** (If the same 3 people are always paged, the operating model is broken.)

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Delivery Throughput (DORA Metrics)

**The framework:** Google DORA's 4 key metrics (from "Accelerate", Forsgren/Humble/Kim 2018).

| Metric | What it measures | Elite | High | Medium | Low |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Deployment Frequency** | How often code reaches prod | Multiple/day | Daily-weekly | Weekly-monthly | < monthly |
| **Lead Time for Changes** | Commit → production | < 1 hour | 1 day-1 week | 1 week-1 month | > 1 month |
| **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)** | Incident detection → resolved | < 1 hour | < 1 day | 1-7 days | > 7 days |
| **Change Failure Rate** | % of deploys causing incidents | 0-15% | 16-30% | 16-45% | 46-60% |

**Bottleneck identification — where does work wait?**

Cycle time = (PR creation → first review) + (review → approval) + (approval → merge) + (merge → deploy). The longest segment is the bottleneck.

Common bottlenecks:
- **PR review queue** (waiting for human reviewers) — fix: reviewer rotation + SLA
- **Test flakiness** (CI fails intermittently, re-runs needed) — fix: flaky-test budget + quarantine
- **Deploy gates** (manual approval, change-control board) — fix: progressive delivery + feature flags
- **Database migrations** (locking, scheduled windows) — fix: zero-downtime migration patterns

**Run** `delivery_throughput_analyzer.py` with sprint data to get DORA verdict + top bottleneck.

See `references/delivery_throughput.md` for the full DORA framework, anti-patterns, and what to fix first.

### 2. Engineering Hiring Funnel

**The trap:** "We can't find good engineers."

The reality: the funnel has 4-6 stages, each with a conversion rate. Find which stage is leakiest; fix that one. "Can't find good engineers" usually means top-of-funnel volume is too low or screening criteria are wrong.

**Standard funnel stages:**

| Stage | Healthy conversion | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| Applied → Sourcer screen | 30-50% | Resume quality |
| Sourcer → Recruiter screen | 50-70% | Basic fit |
| Recruiter → Hiring manager | 60-80% | Team fit |
| Hiring manager → Technical interview | 70-85% | Technical baseline |
| Technical → Onsite (full loop) | 30-50% | Technical depth |
| Onsite → Offer | 25-40% | Final go/no-go |
| Offer → Accept | 70-90% | Comp + close discipline |

**Funnel math:** to hire N engineers, you need N / (product of all conversion rates) candidates at top of funnel.

Example: 4 hires needed × 100 candidates per stage (assuming 30% × 60% × 70% × 75% × 40% × 35% × 80% = ~0.7% end-to-end) = ~570 candidates at top of funnel.

**Run** `eng_hiring_funnel_calculator.py` with funnel data to compute conversion per stage, time-to-fill, and pipeline gap.

See `references/engineering_hiring_funnel.md` for the full funnel framework, common leakage points, and sourcing channel diversification.

### 3. Engineering Team Structure

**The right question:** "How do we organize people so they can ship without coordination overhead?"

**Three-axis model (adapted from Spotify, refined by reality):**

- **Squad:** small autonomous team (5-9 engineers) owning a service or product area end-to-end
- **Chapter:** functional discipline cutting across squads (backend chapter, frontend chapter, etc.) — for skill development, NOT for ownership
- **Tribe:** group of related squads working toward a shared goal (e.g., "platform tribe" = 3 squads on infra)

**When to evolve:**

| Stage | Structure |
|---|---|
| 1-5 engineers | One team. No structure. |
| 6-15 engineers | 2-3 informal pods around major work streams. Founder-CTO can still know everyone. |
| 16-40 engineers | 4-6 squads. First eng manager hires. Chapter structure emerges for cross-squad skill alignment. |
| 41-100 engineers | 2-3 tribes (clusters of squads). Director of engineering layer. Chapters are formal. |
| 100+ engineers | Multiple tribes + group EM/director per tribe. VPE + director(s) + EMs + tech leads. |

**Manager-trigger thresholds:**
- 5-7 ICs without a manager = first EM hire (or internal promote)
- 3+ EMs without a director = director hire
- 8+ teams in one tribe = split the tribe

**Run** `eng_team_structure_designer.py` with team profile for structure recommendation + manager-trigger.

See `references/eng_team_structure.md` for the full framework, Conway's Law implications, and EM-vs-tech-lead split.

### 4. Production Discipline

Production discipline is the operating model that lets the team sleep. Four pillars:

- **On-call rotation:** broad enough to avoid burnout (≥ 6 people per rotation; primary + secondary)
- **Incident response:** runbooks, severity definitions, blameless postmortems
- **Deployment cadence:** continuous deployment OR scheduled releases; both work; surprise releases don't
- **SLO discipline:** every customer-facing service has documented SLOs + error budgets (pair with `engineering/slo-architect/`)

See `references/production_discipline.md` for the full operating model.

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Quarterly Delivery Health Review (4 hours)
**Goal:** Diagnose throughput + identify top bottleneck.

```bash
# 1. Pull sprint metrics: deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, change failure rate
python ../../skills/vpe-advisor/scripts/delivery_throughput_analyzer.py sprint_metrics.json
# 2. Review DORA verdict per metric
# 3. Identify top bottleneck (longest wait stage)
# 4. Cross-check with cs-cto-advisor on architectural causes
# 5. Output: 90-day fix plan with one bottleneck owned by one engineer
# 6. Log via /cs:decide
```

### Workflow 2: Hiring Funnel Diagnosis (1 day)
**Goal:** Identify funnel leakage + compute pipeline gap for hiring target.

```bash
# 1. Pull funnel data from ATS for last 90 days
python ../../skills/vpe-advisor/scripts/eng_hiring_funnel_calculator.py funnel.json
# 2. Identify weakest conversion stage
# 3. Compute pipeline volume needed for next quarter's hiring target
# 4. Cross-check with cs-chro-advisor on comp/leveling competitiveness
# 5. Cross-check with cs-cfo-advisor on cost-per-hire envelope
# 6. Output: top-3 fixes + sourcing channel diversification plan
```

### Workflow 3: Team Structure Audit (1 day)
**Goal:** Confirm team structure matches headcount + work streams.

```bash
# 1. Build team.json: headcount, work streams, manager count, IC distribution
python ../../skills/vpe-advisor/scripts/eng_team_structure_designer.py team.json
# 2. Check manager-trigger thresholds (5-7 IC rule)
# 3. Identify squad sizes outside 5-9 range
# 4. Cross-check with cs-cto-advisor on Conway's Law alignment
# 5. Output: structure recommendations + manager hire plan
```

### Workflow 4: Production Discipline Audit (1 week)
**Goal:** Confirm operating model can scale through current growth.

1. Inventory: on-call coverage, incident frequency by severity, MTTR trend
2. Confirm every customer-facing service has SLOs (pair with `engineering/slo-architect/`)
3. Review last 5 postmortems — are they blameless? Are action items closed?
4. Cross-check deployment cadence against DORA verdict
5. Output: production-discipline maturity score + 90-day improvement plan
