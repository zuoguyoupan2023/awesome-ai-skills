## Research Techniques

### Building a Timeline

1. **Start with overview** - Wikipedia, encyclopedia for basic timeline
2. **Find contemporary coverage** - News from the time
3. **Locate official records** - Government reports, investigations
4. **Add personal accounts** - Memoirs, interviews
5. **Cross-reference dates** - Verify against multiple sources
6. **Note discrepancies** - When sources disagree on dates

### Finding Contemporary Coverage

**Search pattern**:
```
"[event]" site:newspapers.com
"[event]" [year] site:archive.org
"[event]" newspaper [month] [year]
```

**Why contemporary matters**:
- Written before outcome known
- Captures uncertainty of moment
- Different framing than retrospective

### Accessing Archives

**Tips**:
- University libraries often have remote access
- Inter-library loan for books
- FOIA requests for government docs (slow)
- Contact archivists directly (helpful)

### Verifying Historical Claims

1. **Multiple sources** - Don't rely on single account
2. **Primary vs. secondary** - Prefer contemporary documents
3. **Consider perspective** - Who wrote it, why?
4. **Check for corrections** - Later scholarship may revise
5. **Note uncertainty** - Some things remain disputed

|-----|----------------|---------|
| **Early 1900s** | Formal, flowery | "A most unfortunate occurrence" |
| **1920s-30s** | Slang, jazz age | "On the level, see" |
| **1940s** | War-era, patriotic | "For the duration" |
| **1950s** | Conformist, Cold War | "Subversive elements" |
| **1960s-70s** | Revolutionary, casual | "The establishment" |
| **1980s** | Corporate, excess | "Greed is good" |

## Working with Historical Distance

### Challenges

1. **Missing records** - Not everything was preserved
2. **Bias in sources** - Historical perspectives differ from modern
3. **Lost context** - What was obvious then may be obscure now
4. **Evolving interpretation** - Understanding changes over time
5. **Mythologization** - Popular memory may diverge from facts

### Best Practices

1. **Acknowledge gaps** - Note when information is incomplete
2. **Consider perspective** - Whose voice is preserved?
3. **Use multiple sources** - Cross-reference constantly
4. **Distinguish fact from interpretation** - What happened vs. what it meant
5. **Date your sources** - Note when analysis was written

### Handling Sensitive History

When researching difficult topics:
- Use appropriate terminology for the era
- Note evolution of language/understanding
- Consider impact on descendants
- Distinguish documentation from endorsement

## Era-Specific Research Tips

### Pre-Internet (Before ~1995)
- Newspapers.com, archive.org for news
- Library microfilm for local coverage
- Books often best synthesis

### Pre-Television (Before ~1950)
- Radio archives (some preserved)
- Newsreels (archive.org, YouTube)
- Print journalism primary source

### Pre-Photography (Before ~1860)
- Written accounts only
- Illustrations, engravings
- Government records, letters

### Living Memory (Within ~80 years)
- Oral histories valuable
- Participants may still be alive
- Family records, personal archives

## Remember

1. **Primary sources first** - Documents from the time beat retrospectives
2. **Contemporary coverage captures uncertainty** - Before anyone knew how it ended
3. **Cross-reference dates** - Historical dates often disputed
4. **Consider who's telling** - All sources have perspective
5. **Archives are deep** - Archivists can help find hidden gems
6. **Anniversary coverage** - 10/25/50 year marks often bring new research

**Your deliverables**: Archival sources, contemporary quotes, verified timeline, period language, and historical context for lyrics.
