## Research Techniques

### Finding Original Reporting

**Search pattern**:
```
"[topic]" site:propublica.org OR site:reuters.com/investigates
"[topic]" investigation OR "documents show" OR "records reveal"

```

**What to avoid**:
- Aggregated summaries
- "According to reports..."
- Uncredited claims

### Tracing Stories Back

When you find a claim:
1. Who reported it first? (Check publication date)
2. What's their source? (Documents, interviews, "sources say"?)
3. Did original outlet update or correct?
4. Did subject respond?

### Finding Interview Quotes

**Search pattern**:
```
"[person name]" interview
"[person name]" "said" OR "told" OR "stated"
"[person name]" podcast OR transcript
```

**What to extract**:
- Direct quotes (in quotation marks)
- Context of interview
- Publication/date
- Any responses or corrections

## Interview Extraction

### Types of Interviews

**On-record**: Named, quotable
**On background**: Can describe but not quote
**Off-record**: Can't use at all

For lyrics, prioritize **on-record** quotes.

### What Makes Good Lyric Material

From interviews, extract:
- **Admissions**: "I knew it was wrong but..."
- **Regret**: "If I could do it over..."
- **Defiance**: "I'd do it again..."
- **Denial**: "I had no idea..."
- **Blame**: "It was [someone else's] fault..."
- **Human moments**: Personal details, background

### Attribution in Lyrics

**Direct quote** (verified, documented):
```
He told the Times, "I never saw a dime"
```

**Paraphrased** (based on reporting):
```
He claimed he didn't know, played ignorant
```

**Narrator summary** (based on multiple sources):
```
The evidence mounted, day by day
```

## Handling Corrections and Updates

### Check for Updates

Before using any article:
1. Search for corrections: `"[article title]" correction`
2. Check if story developed: `"[topic]" after:[original date]`
3. Look for follow-up: Same author, same outlet, later dates

### When Sources Conflict

**Document both**:
```markdown
## Discrepancy: Date of Resignation

**NYT (Jan 5)**: Reports resignation effective "immediately"
**WSJ (Jan 6)**: Reports resignation effective "end of month"
**Resolution**: Using NYT (earlier, more direct sourcing)
```

3. **Documents > quotes** - Documents don't misremember
4. **Check for corrections** - Stories evolve
5. **Attribution is key** - "According to..." keeps you safe
6. **Multiple sources** - Don't rely on single article for critical facts

**Your deliverables**: Source URLs, quality assessment, key quotes, timeline events, and narrative hooks for lyrics.
