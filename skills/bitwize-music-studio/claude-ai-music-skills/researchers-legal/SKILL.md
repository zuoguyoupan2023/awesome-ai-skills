1. **Page numbers matter** - Always cite page/paragraph for verification
2. **Quotes verbatim** - Legal documents are precise; don't paraphrase
3. **Check all defendants** - Multiple defendants = multiple stories
4. **Follow the cooperation** - Who flipped? That's often the best story
5. **Read the footnotes** - Often contain juicy details
6. **Statement of Facts is gold** - In plea agreements, defendants admit in their own words

**Your deliverables**: Source URLs, key facts with citations, verbatim quotes, timeline events, and lyric potential.
