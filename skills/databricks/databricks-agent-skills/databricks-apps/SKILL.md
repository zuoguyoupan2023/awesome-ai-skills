## Generic Guidelines

- **App name**: ≤26 characters, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only (no underscores). dev- prefix adds 4 chars, max 30 total.
- **Validation**: `databricks apps validate --profile <PROFILE>` before deploying.
- **Smoke tests** (AppKit only): ALWAYS update `tests/smoke.spec.ts` selectors BEFORE running validation. Default template checks for "Minimal Databricks App" heading and "hello world" text — these WILL fail in your custom app. See [testing guide](references/testing.md).
- **Smoke test selectors**: use only Playwright locator APIs — `getByRole`, `getByText`, `getByPlaceholder`, `getByLabel`. `getByLabelText` does not exist in Playwright (it is a React Testing Library method) and throws `TypeError` at runtime. See [testing guide](references/testing.md) or `npx playwright codegen`.
- **Smoke test data**: keep result sets under the 1 MB analytics-event payload cap. Queries returning thousands of rows cause `INVALID_REQUEST: Event exceeds max size of 1048576 bytes` and `net::ERR_ABORTED`, leaving every asserted UI element absent. Use `LIMIT` or an aggregated query (e.g. `COUNT(*) GROUP BY status`) — never raw row dumps.
- **AppKit version**: never override the `@databricks/appkit` or `@databricks/appkit-ui` version in `package.json` — `databricks apps init` sets the correct version. Do not run `npm install @databricks/appkit@<version>` unless explicitly asked by the user. If you need a different version, re-scaffold with `databricks apps init --version <version>`.
- **Authentication**: covered by parent `databricks-core` skill.
- **AppKit API surface**: before writing code that calls AppKit APIs (`createApp`, plugin shapes, `useAnalyticsQuery`, etc.), run `npx @databricks/appkit docs <section>` and use the actual signature. Training data has stale shapes; a single invented signature fails `tsc --noEmit` during validate. The docs ship with the installed AppKit and are the authoritative source.
- **TypeScript casts**: never use `as unknown as <T>` double-assertions — `appkit lint` enforces `no-double-type-assertion` and one violation fails the entire validate step. Instead: narrow with Zod (`z.infer<typeof schema>`), use a runtime type guard, or write a typed mapper function. If a query result needs reshaping, type the row schema via queryKey types rather than casting.

## Project Structure (after `databricks apps init --features analytics`)
- `client/src/App.tsx` — main React component (start here)
- `config/queries/*.sql` — SQL query files (queryKey = filename without .sql)
- `server/server.ts` — backend entry (tRPC routers)
- `tests/smoke.spec.ts` — smoke test (⚠️ MUST UPDATE selectors for your app)
- `client/src/appKitTypes.d.ts` — auto-generated types (`npm run typegen`)

## Project Structure (after `databricks apps init --features lakebase`)
- `server/server.ts` — backend with Lakebase pool + tRPC routes
- `client/src/App.tsx` — React frontend
- `app.yaml` — manifest with `database` resource declaration
- `package.json` — includes `@databricks/lakebase` dependency
- Note: **No `config/queries/`** — Lakebase apps use `pool.query()` in tRPC, not SQL files

## Data Discovery

Before writing any SQL, use the parent `databricks-core` skill for data exploration — search `information_schema` by keyword, then batch `discover-schema` for the tables you need. Do NOT skip this step.

**State Storage Guidance (evaluate BEFORE the Decision Gate):**

If the user's app description involves storing or persisting data — forms, CRUD operations, user submissions, orders, todos, or other user-generated content — the app likely needs a Lakebase database.

1. **Ask the user** whether the app needs persistent storage (Lakebase) before scaffolding. Do not silently add Lakebase.
2. If confirmed, use the **`databricks-lakebase`** skill to create a Lakebase project and obtain the branch and database resource names.
3. Scaffold with `--features lakebase` and pass `--set lakebase.postgres.branch=<BRANCH_NAME> --set lakebase.postgres.database=<DATABASE_NAME>`.
4. If the app **also** reads from Unity Catalog tables, proceed to the Data Access Decision Gate below to determine whether to add `--features analytics` or use Lakebase synced tables.

Do NOT add Lakebase to analytics, dashboard, or visualization apps unless the user explicitly requests persistent write-back storage. Read-only data display, filters, and preferences do not require a database.

## Development Workflow (FOLLOW THIS ORDER)

**Data Access Decision Gate (REQUIRED before scaffolding):**

If the app reads from Unity Catalog / lakehouse tables, you MUST show the comparison below to the user and ask them to choose. Do not skip this. Do not choose for them.

| | **(A) Lakebase synced tables** | **(B) Analytics** |
|--|---|---|
| Speed | Sub-second responses | Takes a few seconds |
| Best for | Full-text search, typeahead, autocomplete, real-time lookups, operational apps | Dashboards, charts, aggregations, KPIs, filtered queries, browsing |
| How it works | Data synced from Delta into Lakebase Postgres | Queries run on SQL warehouse at read time |

After showing the table, add a brief recommendation. Default to recommending Analytics (B) for most read-only apps — dashboards, charts, filtered queries, browsing, and aggregations. Recommend Lakebase synced tables (A) only when the app needs sub-second latency for full-text search, typeahead/autocomplete, real-time lookups by ID, or operational data serving. Note: "search" or "filter" in a prompt usually means SQL WHERE clauses (Analytics), not full-text search (Lakebase). Always let the user make the final call.

After the user chooses:
- (A) Lakebase synced tables → scaffold with `--features lakebase`. See [Lakebase Guide](references/appkit/lakebase.md) for full workflow.
- (B) Analytics → scaffold with `--features analytics`.
- Both → scaffold with `--features analytics,lakebase` if the app needs both patterns.
- If the app does NOT read Unity Catalog data (pure CRUD, Genie, Model Serving), skip this gate and scaffold with the appropriate `--features` flag.

**Analytics apps** (`--features analytics`):

1. Create SQL files in `config/queries/`
2. Run `npm run typegen` — verify all queries show ✓
3. Read `client/src/appKitTypes.d.ts` to see generated types
4. **THEN** write `App.tsx` using the generated types
5. Update `tests/smoke.spec.ts` selectors
6. Run `databricks apps validate --profile <PROFILE>`

**DO NOT** write UI code before running typegen — types won't exist and you'll waste time on compilation errors.

**Lakebase apps** (`--features lakebase`): No SQL files or typegen. See [Lakebase Guide](references/appkit/lakebase.md) for the tRPC pattern: initialize schema at startup, write procedures in `server/server.ts`, then build the React frontend.

## When to Use What

After completing the decision gate above, use this routing table:

- **Read analytics data → display in chart/table**: Use visualization components with `queryKey` prop
- **Read analytics data → custom display (KPIs, cards)**: Use `useAnalyticsQuery` hook
- **Read analytics data → need computation before display**: Still use `useAnalyticsQuery`, transform client-side
- **Read lakehouse data at low latency (lookups, search, catalogs)**: Use Lakebase synced tables — see [Lakebase Guide](references/appkit/lakebase.md)
- **Read/write persistent data (users, orders, CRUD state)**: Use Lakebase pool via tRPC — see [Lakebase Guide](references/appkit/lakebase.md)
- **Natural language query interface over tables (Genie)**: Use `genie()` plugin — see [Genie Guide](references/appkit/genie.md)
- **Call ML model endpoint**: Use `serving()` plugin — see [Model Serving Guide](references/appkit/model-serving.md)
- **Trigger or monitor a Lakeflow Job from the app**: Use the `jobs()` plugin — see [Jobs Guide](references/appkit/jobs.md)
- **⚠️ NEVER use tRPC to run SELECT queries against the warehouse** — always use SQL files in `config/queries/`
- **⚠️ NEVER use `useAnalyticsQuery` for Lakebase data** — it queries the SQL warehouse only

## Frameworks

### AppKit (Recommended)

TypeScript/React framework with type-safe SQL queries and built-in components.

**Official Documentation** — the source of truth for all API details:

```bash
npx @databricks/appkit docs                              # ← ALWAYS start here to see available pages
npx @databricks/appkit docs <query>                      # view a section by name or doc path
npx @databricks/appkit docs --full                       # full index with all API entries
npx @databricks/appkit docs "appkit-ui API reference"    # example: section by name
npx @databricks/appkit docs ./docs/plugins/analytics.md  # example: specific doc file
```

**DO NOT guess doc paths.** Run without args first, pick from the index. The `<query>` argument accepts both section names (from the index) and file paths. Docs are the authority on component props, hook signatures, and server APIs — skill files only cover anti-patterns and gotchas.

**App Manifest and Scaffolding**

**Agent workflow for scaffolding: get the manifest first, then build the init command.**

1. **Get the manifest** (JSON schema describing plugins and their resources):
   ```bash
   databricks apps manifest --profile <PROFILE>
   # See plugins available in a specific AppKit version:
   databricks apps manifest --version <VERSION> --profile <PROFILE>
   # Custom template:
   databricks apps manifest --template <GIT_URL> --profile <PROFILE>
   ```
   The output defines:
   - **Plugins**: each has a key (plugin ID for `--features`), plus `requiredByTemplate`, and `resources`.
   - **requiredByTemplate**: If **true**, that plugin is **mandatory** for this template — do **not** add it to `--features` (it is included automatically); you must still supply all of its required resources via `--set`. If **false** or absent, the plugin is **optional** — add it to `--features` only when the user's prompt indicates they want that capability (e.g. analytics/SQL), and then supply its required resources via `--set`.
   - **Resources**: Each plugin has `resources.required` and `resources.optional` (arrays). Each item has `resourceKey` and `fields` (object: field name → description/env). Use `--set <plugin>.<resourceKey>.<field>=<value>` for each required resource field of every plugin you include.

2. **Scaffold** (DO NOT use `npx`; use the CLI only):
   ```bash
   databricks apps init --name <NAME> --features <plugin1>,<plugin2> \
     --set <plugin1>.<resourceKey>.<field>=<value> \
     --set <plugin2>.<resourceKey>.<field>=<value> \
     --description "<DESC>" --run none --profile <PROFILE>
   # --run none: skip auto-run after scaffolding (review code first)
   # With custom template:
   databricks apps init --template <GIT_URL> --name <NAME> --features ... --set ... --profile <PROFILE>
   ```
   Optionally use `--version <VERSION>` to target a specific AppKit version.
   - **Required**: `--name`, `--profile`. Name: ≤26 chars, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only. Use `--features` only for **optional** plugins the user wants (plugins with `requiredByTemplate: false` or absent); mandatory plugins must not be listed in `--features`.
   - **Resources**: Pass `--set` for every required resource (each field in `resources.required`) for (1) all plugins with `requiredByTemplate: true`, and (2) any optional plugins you added to `--features`. Add `--set` for `resources.optional` only when the user requests them.
   - **Discovery**: Use the parent `databricks-core` skill to resolve IDs (e.g. warehouse: `databricks warehouses list --profile <PROFILE>` or `databricks experimental aitools tools get-default-warehouse --profile <PROFILE>`).

**DO NOT guess** plugin names, resource keys, or property names — always derive them from `databricks apps manifest` output. Example: if the manifest shows plugin `analytics` with a required resource `resourceKey: "sql-warehouse"` and `fields: { "id": ... }`, include `--set analytics.sql-warehouse.id=<ID>`.

**Scaffolding Rules Protocol** — `databricks apps manifest` may emit `scaffolding.rules` at the template level (top-level `scaffolding.rules`) and on individual plugins (`plugins[].scaffolding.rules`). Each block has `must` / `should` / `never` arrays of short directive strings. Consume them as follows:

1. **Gather** — for every plugin in your final `--features` list AND every plugin with `requiredByTemplate: true`, read `plugins[].scaffolding.rules`. Union those with the top-level template `scaffolding.rules` into one working set, tagged by source (template vs `<plugin>`).
2. **Precedence** — manifest rules override the directives baked into this skill. Where the manifest is silent on a topic, this skill's content is the floor.
3. **Phase ordering** — rules whose text begins with `Before init` MUST be executed before `databricks apps init`. Rules beginning with `After init` MUST be executed after init completes (e.g. migrations, typegen, connectivity checks). Rules without a phase prefix apply throughout the scaffold/develop loop.
4. **Conflict detection** — if a plugin `must` rule contradicts a template `never` rule on the same target (or vice versa), STOP and ask the user which to follow before proceeding. Do not silently pick one. Treat `must` vs `never` on the same action as a conflict; `should` is advisory and does not block.
5. **Reporting** — before running `databricks apps init`, surface the merged working set to the user grouped by phase (Before init / After init / Always) and by severity (must / should / never), so the active guardrails are explicit.

**READ [AppKit Overview](references/appkit/overview.md)** for project structure, workflow, and pre-implementation checklist.

**Genie Agent Workflow** — when the user wants a Genie-powered app, do **not** start by asking for a Genie Space ID. Instead:

1. Ask which Unity Catalog tables the app should query (fully qualified: `catalog.schema.table`).
2. Ask whether to reuse an existing Genie space or create a new one.
3. If creating: discover the warehouse, then create the space with `databricks genie create-space` (see [Genie Guide](references/appkit/genie.md) for syntax and serialized space format).
4. If reusing: discover existing spaces with `databricks genie list-spaces --profile <PROFILE>` and let the user pick.
5. Scaffold or wire the space ID into the app — derive `--set` keys from `databricks apps manifest`.

Read the [Genie Guide](references/appkit/genie.md) for configuration, SSE endpoints, and frontend integration.

### Common Scaffolding Mistakes

```bash
# ❌ WRONG: name is NOT a positional argument
databricks apps init --features analytics my-app-name
# → "unknown command" error

# ✅ CORRECT: use --name flag
databricks apps init --name my-app-name --features analytics --set "..." --profile <PROFILE>
```

### Directory Naming

`databricks apps init` creates directories in kebab-case matching the app name.
App names must be lowercase with hyphens only (≤26 chars).

### Other Frameworks (Streamlit, FastAPI, Flask, Gradio, Dash, Next.js, etc.)

Databricks Apps supports any framework that runs as an HTTP server. LLMs already know these frameworks — the challenge is Databricks platform integration.

**READ [Other Frameworks Guide](references/other-frameworks.md) BEFORE building any non-AppKit app.** It covers port/host configuration, `app.yaml` and `databricks.yml` setup, dependency management, networking, and framework-specific gotchas.

### Post-Deploy Verification

After deploying, verify the app is running:

```bash
databricks apps get <app-name> --profile <PROFILE> -o json   # Check app_status.state: RUNNING
databricks apps logs <app-name> --follow --profile <PROFILE>  # Stream live logs (Ctrl+C to stop)
```

> **Note:** `databricks apps logs` requires OAuth authentication and does not work with PAT. Use `databricks apps get` for status checks if using PAT auth.
