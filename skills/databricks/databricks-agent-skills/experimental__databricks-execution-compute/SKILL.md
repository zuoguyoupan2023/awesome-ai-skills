# Databricks Execution & Compute

Run code on Databricks. Three execution modes—choose based on workload.

> **Path convention:** `<SKILL_ROOT>` in examples below = the directory containing this SKILL.md. Resolve it to the absolute path in your install (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/databricks-execution-compute`). Commands like `python <SKILL_ROOT>/scripts/compute.py ...` work from any cwd.

## Execution Mode Decision Matrix

| Aspect | [Databricks Connect](references/1-databricks-connect.md) ⭐ | [Serverless Job](references/2-serverless-job.md) | [Interactive Cluster](references/3-interactive-cluster.md) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Use for** | Spark code (ETL, data gen) | Heavy processing (ML) | State across tool calls, Scala/R |
| **Startup** | Instant | ~25-50s cold start | ~5min if stopped |
| **State** | Within Python process | None | Via context_id |
| **Languages** | Python (PySpark) | Python, SQL | Python, Scala, SQL, R |
| **Dependencies** | `withDependencies()` | CLI with environments spec | Install on cluster |

### Decision Flow

Main decision point: if you're using Declarative Automation Bundles (DABs) then follow the instructions of the [`databricks-dabs` skill](../../skills/databricks-dabs/SKILL.md) first. In short, you can use `databricks bundle run` to run code associated with jobs, pipelines, and other resources. This can be recognized by looking for a `databricks.yml` file in the project root. If these resources don't exist, or if you're not using DABs, then proceed with the below.

Prefer Databricks Connect for all spark-based workload, then serverless.
```
Spark-based code? → Databricks Connect (fastest)
  └─ Python 3.12 missing? → Install it + databricks-connect
  └─ Install fails? → Ask user (don't auto-switch modes)

Heavy/long-running (ML)? → Serverless Job (independent)
Need state across calls? → Interactive Cluster (list and ask which one to use)
Scala/R? → Interactive Cluster (list and ask which one to use)
```


## How to Run Code

**Read the reference file for your chosen mode before proceeding.**

### Databricks Connect (run locally, prefer when it's pure spark code) → [reference](references/1-databricks-connect.md)

```bash
from databricks.connect import DatabricksSession
...
spark = DatabricksSession.builder.profile("my-local-profile").serverless(True).getOrCreate()


python my_spark_script.py
```

### Serverless Job → [reference](references/2-serverless-job.md)

Pure CLI flow: upload a local file as a workspace notebook, fire a one-time run with `databricks jobs submit` (create + run in one call, ephemeral — no Jobs UI entry, no retry), then poll + fetch the result. The local file must be a Databricks source notebook — top line `# Databricks notebook source` (Python) or `-- Databricks notebook source` (SQL).

**1. Upload the local file as a workspace notebook.** `TARGET_PATH` is positional; `--file` is the local path.

`databricks workspace import /Workspace/Users/<user>/.ai_dev_kit/train --file /local/path/to/train.py --format SOURCE --language PYTHON --overwrite`

**2. Submit the run.** Use `--no-wait` to get `{"run_id": N}` back immediately; drop it to block until terminated. **`"client": "4"` is required** for `dependencies` to install (`"1"` silently ignores them).

`databricks jobs submit --no-wait --json @submit.json`

```json
{
  "run_name": "train-run",
  "tasks": [{
    "task_key": "main",
    "notebook_task": {"notebook_path": "/Workspace/Users/<user>/.ai_dev_kit/train"},
    "environment_key": "ml_env"
  }],
  "environments": [{
    "environment_key": "ml_env",
    "spec": {"client": "4", "dependencies": ["scikit-learn==1.5.2", "mlflow==2.22.0"]}
  }]
}
```

**3. Check state / wait for completion.** Life-cycle: `PENDING` → `RUNNING` → `TERMINATED` (or `SKIPPED` / `INTERNAL_ERROR`). Only read `.state.result_state` (`SUCCESS` / `FAILED` / `CANCELED`) once life-cycle is `TERMINATED`.

`databricks jobs get-run <RUN_ID> | jq '{state: .state.life_cycle_state, result: .state.result_state, duration_ms: .execution_duration, url: .run_page_url, task_run_id: .tasks[0].run_id}'`

**4. Fetch the output / error.** **Gotcha:** `get-run-output` takes the **task** run_id (`.tasks[0].run_id`), NOT the parent `run_id` from submit. `notebook_output.result` is the string passed to `dbutils.notebook.exit()`.

`databricks jobs get-run-output <TASK_RUN_ID> | jq '{result: .notebook_output.result, error, error_trace}'`

Always use `dbutils.notebook.exit(<string>)` in the notebook — `print()` is not captured by `get-run-output`. For JSON results: `dbutils.notebook.exit(json.dumps({...}))` then parse `.notebook_output.result` client-side.

**Convenience wrapper.** `scripts/compute.py execute-code` does upload + submit + wait + cleanup in one command and returns a single tidy JSON:

`python <SKILL_ROOT>/scripts/compute.py execute-code --file /local/path/to/train.py --compute-type serverless --timeout 1500 --environments '[{"environment_key":"ml_env","spec":{"client":"4","dependencies":["scikit-learn==1.5.2","mlflow==2.22.0"]}}]' | jq '{success, state, output, error, run_id, run_page_url, execution_duration_ms}'`

### Interactive Cluster → [reference](references/3-interactive-cluster.md)

**Avoid by default — prefer Serverless Job.** Only use an interactive cluster when:
- you have an existing classic cluster already running and available, or
- you need live, stateful execution across multiple calls (debugging via an execution context), or
- the user explicitly asks for it.

Interactive clusters are **slow to start (3-8 min)** and cost money while running. Don't start one implicitly.

## CLI Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `python <SKILL_ROOT>/scripts/compute.py execute-code` | Run code on serverless or an existing cluster |
| `python <SKILL_ROOT>/scripts/compute.py list-compute` | List clusters, node types, Spark versions |
| `python <SKILL_ROOT>/scripts/compute.py manage-cluster` | Create/start/terminate/delete clusters (see [3-interactive-cluster.md](references/3-interactive-cluster.md)) |
| `databricks warehouses create/list` | Manage SQL warehouses |

### SQL Warehouses

All `ID`-taking commands use positional arg (no `--id` flag). Use `databricks warehouses list` to find an ID.

```bash
# Create a serverless SQL warehouse. min_num_clusters + max_num_clusters are REQUIRED
# (the server rejects the default 0). Keep the aidevkit_project tag for resource tracking.
databricks warehouses create --json '{
  "name": "my-warehouse",
  "cluster_size": "Small",
  "enable_serverless_compute": true,
  "auto_stop_mins": 10,
  "min_num_clusters": 1,
  "max_num_clusters": 1,
  "tags": {"custom_tags": [{"key": "aidevkit_project", "value": "ai-dev-kit"}]}
}'

# List / find — trim to id, name, state with jq
databricks warehouses list -o json | jq '.[] | {id, name, state, size: .cluster_size}'

# Find by name
databricks warehouses list -o json | jq '.[] | select(.name == "my-warehouse")'

# Get one warehouse's full config
databricks warehouses get <WAREHOUSE_ID>

# Start / stop (both are LROs; add --no-wait to return immediately)
databricks warehouses start <WAREHOUSE_ID>
databricks warehouses stop  <WAREHOUSE_ID>

# Resize / reconfigure — pass the FULL desired config (omitted fields revert to defaults,
# so always re-state min_num_clusters/max_num_clusters). Use --no-wait if the warehouse
# is STOPPED, otherwise edit blocks trying to reach RUNNING and errors out (the mutation
# itself still applies). When the warehouse is already RUNNING, --no-wait is optional.
databricks warehouses edit <WAREHOUSE_ID> --no-wait --json '{
  "name": "my-warehouse",
  "cluster_size": "Medium",
  "enable_serverless_compute": true,
  "auto_stop_mins": 15,
  "min_num_clusters": 1,
  "max_num_clusters": 1
}'

# Delete (irreversible)
databricks warehouses delete <WAREHOUSE_ID>
```

**Sizes:** `2X-Small`, `X-Small`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `X-Large`, `2X-Large`, `3X-Large`, `4X-Large`. **Types:** set `"warehouse_type": "PRO"` (default) or `"CLASSIC"` in the JSON body.
