name: statusline-generator
description: Install, configure, customize, or troubleshoot the Claude Code statusline (the line above the prompt with cwd, model, and token counts). Use when the user wants to set up or change the statusline, switch between minimal and full layouts, show absolute token counts (e.g. ctx 108K / 1M) instead of a percentage, add cost via ccusage or git status, or fix a statusline that is blank, silent, stuck, shows "permission denied", or stopped updating after a script edit (commonly a missing chmod +x). Also covers debug-dumping the stdin JSON Claude Code passes the script. Trigger phrases include "configure statusline", "statusline blank", "status line not showing", "statusline broken", "show token count in statusline", 状态栏, 状态栏不显示, 状态栏空白, 显示工作目录, 显示 token 数.

# Statusline Generator

A single-source-of-truth statusline for Claude Code. One script, two layouts,
end-to-end self-verification.

## Quick health check (start here when something is wrong)

Run this first whenever the statusline misbehaves. It catches the silent failures
that account for most "configured but not working" reports:

```bash
bash scripts/health_check.sh
```

It validates four layers:
1. `~/.claude/statusline.sh` exists and is executable. **Missing `chmod +x` is
   the single most common silent-failure cause** — Claude Code runs the script,
   `exec` fails, statusline goes blank.
2. `~/.claude/settings.json` has a valid `statusLine` block pointing at the script.
3. Mock stdin tests covering complete data, zero tokens, missing fields,
   and `$HOME` path shortening.
4. Real stdin replay from `/tmp/.claude-statusline-last-stdin.json` if you
   previously ran with `CLAUDE_STATUSLINE_DEBUG=1`.

Each failure prints a one-line fix command — you don't have to read documentation
to recover.

## Quick install

```bash
bash scripts/install_statusline.sh
```

This script:
- Backs up any existing `~/.claude/statusline.sh` and `settings.json`.
- Copies `generate_statusline.sh` to `~/.claude/statusline.sh` and `chmod +x`s it.
- Updates `settings.json` `statusLine` block via `jq` (preserves other settings).
- **Mandatorily runs `health_check.sh` and shows the result** — installation
  is not "complete" until verification passes.

Restart Claude Code (or send any new message) to see the statusline update.

## What you get

### Default — minimal one-line layout

```
~/code/myproject  Opus 4.7 (1M context)  ctx: 108K / 1M
```

Just the essentials: short path, model name, absolute token counts. No colors,
no git, no cost, no percentage. Designed for users who want signal without noise.

### Full — multi-line with cost and git

Set `CLAUDE_STATUSLINE_LAYOUT=full` in your shell profile to enable:

```
alex (Sonnet 4.6) [$0.42/$25.93]  ctx: 108K/1M (11%)
~/code/myproject
[git:main*+]
```

- Line 1: user, model, ccusage session/daily costs, color-coded ctx (green ≤50%,
  yellow 51–80%, red >80%).
- Line 2: short path.
- Line 3: git branch with `*` for modified, `+` for untracked.

## Layouts: how to switch

The script reads layout from environment, not flags (Claude Code passes JSON on stdin,
so flags would conflict). Set in `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
# Minimal (default — same as not setting it)
export CLAUDE_STATUSLINE_LAYOUT=minimal

# Full
export CLAUDE_STATUSLINE_LAYOUT=full
```

Restart your shell (or `source` the rc file) so Claude Code inherits the change,
then send a message — statusline refreshes within 300ms.

## Debug stdin capture

To see exactly what JSON Claude Code sends your script:

```bash
export CLAUDE_STATUSLINE_DEBUG=1
```

Each invocation writes its stdin to `/tmp/.claude-statusline-last-stdin.json`
(overwriting on every refresh). Inspect with `jq .`. Useful for:

- Diagnosing why a field doesn't render the way you expect.
- Re-running the script against real input: `cat /tmp/.claude-statusline-last-stdin.json | ~/.claude/statusline.sh`.
- Filing bug reports — paste the dump as ground truth.

## Authoring rules (why this skill is shaped this way)

Two production failure modes drove the current design. Both are sealed in code,
not just docs:

### Rule 1 — Always `chmod +x`, always verify by running

The single biggest silent-failure cause of any statusline is a script without
the executable bit: Claude Code's `exec` fails silently and the bar goes blank
with no error. `install_statusline.sh` always `chmod +x`s; `health_check.sh`
flags the bit if missing. **If you hand-write or hand-edit a statusline script,
mock-test it before declaring done:** `echo '{}' | bash your-script.sh`.

### Rule 2 — "Configuration complete" is meaningless without evidence

"Wrote the file and updated settings.json" is not the same as "the script runs
and produces the expected output." `install_statusline.sh` therefore always
runs `health_check.sh` at the end and exits non-zero if any check fails.
Treat any "complete!" report from any agent that lacks evidence as suspect.

For field-level traps (`used_percentage` null at session start, `total_input_tokens`
semantics across Claude Code versions, hardcoded `context_window_size`), see
[`references/context-window-schema.md`](references/context-window-schema.md).

## Customization

For colors, custom segments (hostname, time, etc.), and disabling cost tracking,
see [`references/customization.md`](references/customization.md).

## Dependencies

The script auto-detects available tools and degrades gracefully:

| Tool | Required for | Fallback |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `jq` | JSON parsing (preferred) | falls back to `python3` |
| `python3` | JSON parsing fallback | bare `cwd` only |
| `awk` | token K/M formatting | required by both layouts |
| `git` | git status (full layout) | silent skip if missing or not in repo |
| `ccusage` | cost (full layout) | silent skip if missing |

Install on macOS: `brew install jq`. On Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install jq`.

## Troubleshooting

For symptom-by-symptom diagnostics, see
[`references/troubleshooting-decision-tree.md`](references/troubleshooting-decision-tree.md).
It walks through:

1. Statusline blank or never updates (chmod cause)
2. ctx segment missing or wrong (field traps)
3. Want token counts not percentages (layout switch)
4. Colors render as raw escape codes (terminal compatibility)
5. Git segment missing (full layout)
6. Cost segment missing (ccusage / cache)
7. Edits have no effect (path mismatch)
8. Slow refresh (jq vs python3)
