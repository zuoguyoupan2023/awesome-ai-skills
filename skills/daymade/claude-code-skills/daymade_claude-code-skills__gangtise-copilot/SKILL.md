# Gangtise Copilot

One-command installer, credential configurator, and diagnostic layer for the full Gangtise (岗底斯投研) OpenAPI skill suite.

---

## 🚀 One-shot installation (complete flow)

This is the **only section you need to read** to go from zero to fully working Gangtise. Follow steps in order.

### Step 1 — Download this skill to your agent's skills directory

**Primary method** (git clone):
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/daymade/claude-code-skills.git /tmp/gangtise-repo
cp -r /tmp/gangtise-repo/gangtise-copilot <your-agent-skills-dir>/
```

**Fallback method** (when git clone times out or is unavailable — use GitHub API directly):
```python
# Python one-liner to download and write any file from GitHub:
import urllib.request, json, base64, os
def fetch_github_file(repo_path, local_path):
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/daymade/claude-code-skills/contents/{repo_path}"
    req = urllib.request.Request(url, headers={"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"})
    d = json.loads(urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=20).read())
    content = base64.b64decode(d["content"]).decode("utf-8")
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(local_path), exist_ok=True)
    open(local_path, "w").write(content)
    return len(content)

# Download all files:
for path, local in [
    ("gangtise-copilot/SKILL.md",                         "<skills-dir>/gangtise-copilot/SKILL.md"),
    ("gangtise-copilot/scripts/install_gangtise.sh",      "<skills-dir>/gangtise-copilot/scripts/install_gangtise.sh"),
    ("gangtise-copilot/scripts/configure_auth.sh",        "<skills-dir>/gangtise-copilot/scripts/configure_auth.sh"),
    ("gangtise-copilot/scripts/diagnose.sh",              "<skills-dir>/gangtise-copilot/scripts/diagnose.sh"),
    ("gangtise-copilot/references/installation_flow.md",   "<skills-dir>/gangtise-copilot/references/installation_flow.md"),
    ("gangtise-copilot/references/credentials_setup.md",    "<skills-dir>/gangtise-copilot/references/credentials_setup.md"),
    ("gangtise-copilot/references/skill_registry.md",       "<skills-dir>/gangtise-copilot/references/skill_registry.md"),
    ("gangtise-copilot/references/known_issues.md",         "<skills-dir>/gangtise-copilot/references/known_issues.md"),
    ("gangtise-copilot/references/best_practices.md",       "<skills-dir>/gangtise-copilot/references/best_practices.md"),
    ("gangtise-copilot/config-template/authorization.json.example", "<skills-dir>/gangtise-copilot/config-template/authorization.json.example"),
]:
    size = fetch_github_file(path, local)
    print(f"OK {path} → {local} ({size} bytes)")
```

> **Important**: Network to GitHub may be unstable. If any file fails, retry the specific file up to 3 times with a 2-second delay between attempts. Do NOT abort the whole process for a single file failure.

### Step 2 — Register this skill with your agent

For **OpenClaw**: create a symlink in the agent's skills directory and enable it in gateway config:
```bash
# Find the OpenClaw skills directory
ls ~/workspace/agent/skills/     # or ls ~/.openclaw/skills/

# Symlink this skill
ln -sf <gangtise-copilot-source-dir> <openclaw-skills-dir>/gangtise-copilot

# Enable in OpenClaw gateway config (if the agent supports skill entries in config)
# Run: openclaw config set 'skills.entries.gangtise-copilot' '{}'
# Then restart the gateway: sh scripts/restart.sh
```

### Step 3 — Install all 19 Gangtise official skills

```bash
bash <gangtise-copilot-dir>/scripts/install_gangtise.sh --preset full
```

**What it does**: Downloads 4 ZIP bundles from the official Huawei Cloud OBS bucket, extracts 19 skill directories, and symlinks them into detected agent skills directories (`~/.openclaw/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, etc.).

**Known agent skills directory paths** (if auto-detection misses yours):

| Agent | Skills directory |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Codex | `~/.agents/skills/` |
| OpenClaw | `~/.openclaw/skills/` or `<agent-workspace>/skills/` |

If install fails, check `references/installation_flow.md`.

### Step 4 — Configure credentials

```bash
bash <gangtise-copilot-dir>/scripts/configure_auth.sh \
  --access-key <your-accessKey> \
  --secret-key <your-secretAccessKey>
```

**What it does**:
1. Writes `~/.config/gangtise/authorization.json` (mode 600)
2. Performs live auth call to verify credentials work
3. Writes `~/.GTS_AUTHORIZATION` runtime token
4. **Creates symlinks** from every installed skill's `scripts/.authorization` to the shared credential file

> ⚠️ **Critical**: After Step 3, `diagnose.sh` may report "19 skill(s) missing .authorization" even if credentials exist. Run Step 4 even when `~/.config/gangtise/authorization.json` already exists — `configure_auth.sh` creates the missing symlinks.

### Step 5 — Verify installation

```bash
bash <gangtise-copilot-dir>/scripts/diagnose.sh
```

Expected output: **9 pass ✅, 0 fail ❌** — all 19 skills present, credentials valid, RAG reachable.

If any ❌ or ⚠️ remains, cross-reference with `references/known_issues.md`.

### Step 6 — Test with a real query

```bash
# Example: query latest research report for 宁德时代
# Use gangtise-file-client with its report runner:
cd <gangtise-copilot-dir>/references/
# See skill_registry.md for the exact command per skill
```

## Overview

Gangtise is a Chinese professional investment-research data platform. It publishes an OpenAPI that covers research reports, company announcements, meeting summaries, chief analyst opinions, financial statements, valuation metrics, OHLC market data, shareholder data, industry indicators, and a catalog of pre-built research workflow skills. The underlying API is well-designed, but the skill ecosystem is **not discoverable**: there is no public manifest listing the 19 skills, the skills are distributed as independent ZIP files on a Huawei Cloud OBS bucket with listing permission disabled, and the skills live in two parallel naming conventions (`gangtise-<name>` for the minimal line, `gangtise-<name>-client` for the full-capability line) that carry different feature sets. A first-time user has to reverse-engineer the complete skill inventory before they can install it.

Gangtise Copilot solves this in one command:

1. Installs all 19 official Gangtise skills to Claude Code, OpenClaw, and Codex via a single bundled-download + distribute pipeline.
2. Walks the user through accessKey + secretAccessKey setup with a live authentication call against `open.gangtise.com/application/auth/oauth/open/loginV2`.
3. Provides a read-only diagnostic script that reports which skills are installed, which credentials are valid, and which capability tiers are reachable.
4. Exposes preset install modes (`minimal` / `workshop` / `full`) so users can match the install size to what their account license actually permits — see ISSUE-007 in `references/known_issues.md` for why "biggest install" is not the safe default.

**Runtime note from April 2026 usage**: after installing skills, run `configure_auth.sh` even if `~/.config/gangtise/authorization.json` already exists. Upstream CLI scripts also read `~/.GTS_AUTHORIZATION`, a bare runtime token file. The configurator refreshes both files.

## Architectural principles (do not violate)

This skill is a **wrapper layer** around the Gangtise OpenAPI skill suite. The wrapper contract is non-negotiable:

- **Never vendor upstream files.** This skill directory contains no copy, fork, or excerpt of any Gangtise skill content. When Gangtise ships a new release, users get the new release without any interference from this wrapper — the installer re-downloads from the canonical OBS URL every run.
- **Repairs (if any arise) happen at runtime, not at ship time.** This wrapper was distilled from a session that encountered no actual upstream bugs — the friction was discoverability and install orchestration, not broken files. If future upstream bugs arise, they will be added to `references/known_issues.md` with runtime repair instructions, not patched at ship time.
- **Always ask before touching upstream files.** Modifying any installed `gangtise-*` skill directory requires explicit user consent via AskUserQuestion.
- **Teach rather than hide.** Every installation step shows the user exactly which skills were downloaded, from where, and where the credential file was saved. This is how users learn to maintain their own installs.

## What this skill does

| Capability | Entry point | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Install Gangtise skills (minimal default, workshop alias, full, or `--only` custom) | `scripts/install_gangtise.sh` | See `references/installation_flow.md` |
| 2. Configure accessKey + secretAccessKey credentials | `scripts/configure_auth.sh` | See `references/credentials_setup.md` |
| 3. Diagnose install state, credential validity, and capability tiers | `scripts/diagnose.sh` | See `references/known_issues.md` |
| 4. Look up which Gangtise skill answers a specific data question | Skill registry below + `references/skill_registry.md` | — |

## Routing

When this skill is triggered, classify the user's intent and jump to the corresponding capability:

| User says something like… | Go to |
|---|---|
| "装 gangtise"、"install gangtise"、"我想用 gangtise 的数据"、"把 gangtise 的 skill 都装上" | **One-shot installation (Step 1–5 above)** |
| "配 gangtise 的 key"、"configure gangtise credentials"、"gangtise accessKey"、"secretAccessKey" | **Capability 2** |
| "gangtise 报错"、"token is invalid"、"接口地址错误"、"gangtise skill 加载失败"、"我的 gangtise 装得不对" | **Capability 3** |
| "宁德时代的研报"、"过去 30 天的首席观点"、"OHLC 蜡烛图"、"个股研究报告 L2"、"对宁德时代做观点 PK" | **Capability 4** → skill registry → invoke the matching upstream skill |
| "帮我从头跑一遍 gangtise" | One-shot installation (Step 1–5 in sequence) |

When in doubt, start with **Capability 3** (`diagnose.sh`) — it is the only read-only entry point and it surfaces exactly which installs and credentials are currently blocked. Running it never has a destructive side effect.

## Capability 1: Install Gangtise skills

Gangtise publishes 19 independent skills on a Huawei Cloud OBS bucket. They are organized into 3 bundle ZIPs plus 1 standalone ZIP. The installer downloads the 4 archives, extracts the 19 skill directories, and symlinks each one into the detected agents' skills directories.

### Distribution source

All skills come from the official Gangtise OBS bucket:

```
https://gts-download.obs.myhuaweicloud.com/skills/
```

No mirrors. The installer uses this URL directly.

### Bundle map

| Bundle | Size | Contains |
|---|---|---|
| `gangtise-skills-client.zip` | 160 KB | data-client, kb-client, file-client, **file-client-no-download**, **stockpool-client** |
| `gangtise-research.zip` | 220 KB | stock-research, opinion-pk, thematic-research, stock-selector, event-review, interview-outline, announcement-digest, opinion-summarizer, wechat-summary, data-processor |
| `gangtise-skills.zip` | 118 KB | data (v1.2.0), file, kb — the legacy "minimal" parallel line |
| `gangtise-web-client.zip` | 8 KB | web-client (standalone, not in any bundle) |

**Total**: 4 HTTP requests → 19 skill directories.

Two skills (`gangtise-file-client-no-download` and `gangtise-stockpool-client`) **only exist inside the `gangtise-skills-client` bundle** — they do not have standalone ZIPs. A naive "list the standalone ZIP for each skill" approach would miss them entirely. See `references/known_issues.md` ISSUE-002 for the full explanation.

### One-command install

```bash
bash scripts/install_gangtise.sh
```

Flags:

```bash
bash scripts/install_gangtise.sh --preset minimal    # default — 3 skills via public open-* endpoints
bash scripts/install_gangtise.sh --preset workshop   # alias for minimal (same 3 skills)
bash scripts/install_gangtise.sh --preset full       # all 19 skills (most -client will fail without skills-backend ACL)
bash scripts/install_gangtise.sh --only data-client,kb-client,file-client  # custom subset
bash scripts/install_gangtise.sh --no-openclaw       # skip OpenClaw even if detected
bash scripts/install_gangtise.sh --target claude-code  # force single target
```

### Preset contents

| Preset | Skills | Intended for |
|---|---|---|
| **minimal** (default) | `gangtise-data`, `gangtise-file`, `gangtise-kb` | Conservative install that works on any account that can authenticate. Uses public `open-*` endpoints only — immune to ISSUE-007. Covers OHLC, financials, announcements, foreign reports, RAG retrieval. |
| **workshop** | (alias for `minimal` — same 3 skills) | Historical preset bundled 7 `-client`-heavy skills, but those are blocked by ISSUE-007 on most accounts and produce a broken live demo. The preset now points at the same 3 skills as `minimal` so it can no longer footgun a workshop. |
| **full** | All 19 skills | Both lines side-by-side. Useful for exploring the full Gangtise catalog. **Most `-client` skills will fail at runtime if your account lacks `skills-backend/*` ACL** — confirm with the diagnostic in ISSUE-007 first. |

## Capability 2: Configure credentials

Every Gangtise skill needs an `.authorization` credential file colocated with its Python runtime, in one of two shapes:

**Shape A** — accessKey + secretAccessKey (most common, auto-refreshes tokens):
```json
{
  "accessKey": "<your-accessKey>",
  "secretAccessKey": "<your-secretAccessKey>"
}
```

**Shape B** — long-term token (advanced, for pre-generated long-lived tokens):
```json
{
  "long-term-token": "Bearer <token>"
}
```

Because 19 skills each need the same `.authorization` file, the wrapper stores **one shared file** at `~/.config/gangtise/authorization.json` (XDG standard, mode 600) and symlinks every skill's local credential file to it. Rotating credentials means editing one file, not 19.

Run the configurator:

```bash
bash scripts/configure_auth.sh
```

It will:

1. Prompt for accessKey and secretAccessKey (or read from the `GANGTISE_ACCESS_KEY` / `GANGTISE_SECRET_KEY` environment variables if set).
2. Write to `~/.config/gangtise/authorization.json` with mode 600.
3. Perform a **live authentication call** to `https://open.gangtise.com/application/auth/oauth/open/loginV2` to verify the credentials actually work.
4. Write `~/.GTS_AUTHORIZATION` with the bare runtime token required by upstream CLI scripts.
5. Create symlinks from every installed skill's local credential file to the shared XDG file.
6. Report success with the uid + userName returned by the Gangtise auth server.

### Credential rotation

```bash
# Edit one file:
$EDITOR ~/.config/gangtise/authorization.json

# Re-verify against the live server:
bash scripts/configure_auth.sh --verify-only
```

No other files need to change — the symlinks still point at the updated file.

## Capability 3: Diagnose install state

```bash
bash scripts/diagnose.sh
```

The diagnostic script is **strictly read-only**. It checks:

- Which of the 19 skills are present in each detected agent's `skills/` directory
- Whether `~/.config/gangtise/authorization.json` exists with mode 600
- Whether each skill's local credential file is a valid symlink pointing at the shared XDG file
- Whether the stored credentials pass a live authentication call (short probe that only needs `oauth/open/loginV2`)
- Whether the canonical RAG endpoint responds to a minimal query (scoped liveness check — proves the credential has `rag` scope, not just auth scope)

Exit codes:

- `0` — all healthy
- `1` — one or more issues need user action
- `2` — diagnostic itself failed (network error, no internet, etc.)

If diagnose reports issues, cross-reference the output against `references/known_issues.md`. Each reported issue maps to a specific remediation section.

## Capability 4: Skill registry — "which skill answers my data question?"

This is the non-obvious value of the wrapper. Gangtise's 19 skills form a **two-dimensional matrix** (data tier × operation type) that is not clearly documented. Use this table to route a user question to the right skill:

### Data-layer skills (6)

| Want to… | Upstream skill | Invoke |
|---|---|---|
| Query semantic content across knowledge base (reports + opinions + minutes) | gangtise-kb-client | `kb` runner with `-q` query + optional `--file-types` / `--securities` |
| List documents by type + date + security (reports, announcements, summaries, opinions, roadshows) | gangtise-file-client | dedicated runners per document type (report / opinion / summary / announcement / investment_calendar / foreign_report / internal_report / wechat_message) |
| Pull OHLC daily candles for an A-share or HK stock | gangtise-data-client | `quote` runner with `--securities {name}` + `-sd` / `-ed` date range |
| Pull financial statements (income / balance / cash flow indicators) | gangtise-data-client | `financial` runner with `--securities {name}` + `--indicators` |
| Pull valuation metrics (PE / PS / PB / PEG + historical percentiles) | gangtise-data-client | `valuation` runner with `--securities {name}` |
| Pull main business composition (by product / industry / region) | gangtise-data-client | `main_business` runner with `--securities {name}` + `--classify-method` |
| Pull shareholder / top-holder data | gangtise-data-client | `shareholder` runner with `--securities {name}` |
| Pull macro / industry indicators (GDP, CPI, vehicle sales, commodity prices) | gangtise-data-client | `industry_indicator` runner with `-k {keyword}` |
| Look up security standard codes by name | gangtise-data-client | `security` runner with `-k {name}` |
| List sector constituent stocks by theme or industry | gangtise-data-client | `block_component` runner with `-k {theme}` |
| List index members by category | gangtise-data-client | `index` runner with `-k {index type}` |
| Search the open web for public information not in Gangtise's internal KB | gangtise-web-client | `web` runner with `-q {query}` |

See [`references/skill_registry.md`](references/skill_registry.md) for the full per-runner parameter reference and cross-skill composition examples.

### Workflow-layer skills (10) — higher-order research workflows

These skills **orchestrate** the data-layer skills into end-to-end research workflows. They produce Markdown + HTML reports following Gangtise's professional investment-research templates and built-in compliance guardrails (no "买入 / 卖出 / 目标价 / 推荐" language).

| Want to… | Use |
|---|---|
| Generate a stock research report at L1-L4 depth (L1 = 1-page framework, L4 = full institutional coverage) | `gangtise-stock-research` |
| Do adversarial analysis on an investment thesis ("play devil's advocate for this long call") | `gangtise-opinion-pk` |
| Do thematic / sector research (driver analysis, enumeration phase, stock screening, performance check) | `gangtise-thematic-research` |
| Screen stocks based on research criteria | `gangtise-stock-selector` |
| Write an 800-1000 word event review / post-mortem for a market event | `gangtise-event-review` |
| Generate a company-meeting outline (3-step workflow: data → topics → questions) | `gangtise-interview-outline` |
| Track recent announcements for a stock pool and produce a daily digest | `gangtise-announcement-digest` |
| Summarize a chief analyst's recent opinions | `gangtise-opinion-summarizer` |
| Turn a WeChat chat-group discussion log into a structured investment daily | `gangtise-wechat-summary` |
| Get methodology guidance on how to design a custom data-processing workflow | `gangtise-data-processor` |

### Utility skills (3)

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `gangtise-stockpool-client` | Create / rename / delete a stock pool; add or remove stocks from it. Only distributed inside `gangtise-skills-client.zip`. |
| `gangtise-file-client-no-download` | Variant of `file-client` that disables the download capability — useful in read-only environments or compliance-sensitive contexts. |
| Legacy `gangtise-data` / `gangtise-file` / `gangtise-kb` | The older minimal parallel line. `data` is v1.2.0 with strictly-typed security codes (no name resolution). Only install if the user wants the smaller feature footprint. |

See `references/skill_registry.md` for the full per-skill script catalog, versions, and capability matrix.

## What this skill refuses to do

- Vendor, fork, or mirror any `gangtise-*` skill's content into this directory — only the canonical OBS URLs are referenced.
- Pin an upstream skill version in SKILL.md — the installer always downloads the current OBS artifact.
- Silently patch upstream files — every modification path (if any are ever added) would require explicit consent via AskUserQuestion.
- Hardcode personal accessKey / secretAccessKey values.
- Make investment recommendations or trading decisions. Gangtise's own skills already enforce these compliance rules; this wrapper strictly delegates.
