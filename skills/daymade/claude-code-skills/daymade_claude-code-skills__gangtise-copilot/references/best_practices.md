# Gangtise Copilot — Best Practices

Non-obvious patterns for getting the most value out of the Gangtise skill catalog after installation. Read this when you've installed the skills and are wondering "okay, now what do I actually do with them?"

## The two-level mental model

Gangtise's 19 skills are organized into two layers that you should think of differently:

1. **Data-layer skills (gangtise-data-client, gangtise-kb-client, gangtise-file-client, gangtise-web-client, gangtise-stockpool-client)** — primitive operations. Each script returns a specific data structure (CSV, file list, text chunks). Don't call them directly in a live demo unless you're teaching the primitive; they're building blocks, not finished products.

2. **Workflow-layer skills (the 10 `gangtise-*` in the research bundle)** — finished research deliverables. Each one encodes a full professional workflow — data retrieval, analysis, writing, formatting — and outputs an MD + HTML report. Call these in live demos because they produce something the audience can *see*.

**The mistake a new user makes**: invoking `gangtise-data-client/quote.py` directly, getting back a CSV of 252 rows of OHLC data, and thinking "now what?" The workflow-layer skill `gangtise-stock-research` L2 answers "now what" — it wraps the same quote data into a research narrative.

## Skill composition patterns

### Pattern 1: Single flagship skill for quick wins

For a 10-minute demo, invoke a single workflow-layer skill end-to-end:

- **Stock research report**: `gangtise-stock-research` L2 on any named stock → complete investment view in one invocation.
- **Daily monitoring digest**: `gangtise-announcement-digest` with a stock pool → daily push to Feishu.
- **Devil's advocate review**: `gangtise-opinion-pk` on a named stock with user's thesis → risk scan MD + HTML.

The workflow-layer skills are designed for single-shot use and produce publication-ready output. Don't try to chain them together in a first demo — the output of one is not the input of another by default.

### Pattern 2: Data → workflow → revision

For deeper research, pair a data-layer skill with a workflow-layer skill:

1. Use `gangtise-data-client/financial.py` to pull specific metrics you care about (e.g., operating margin over 8 quarters).
2. Feed those numbers as context into `gangtise-stock-research` — the workflow skill will incorporate them into its narrative.
3. Run `gangtise-opinion-pk` on the resulting thesis for a risk scan.

This three-step composition produces a "my view + adversarial critique" pair that reads far more like institutional research than a single skill call.

### Pattern 3: Enumerate → filter → deepen

For industry research, fan out with the enumeration skills:

1. `gangtise-data-client/block_component.py -k 新能源汽车` → get constituent stocks
2. `gangtise-data-client/valuation.py --securities-file block_component_1.csv` → valuation data for each
3. Sort, filter, pick the top 3 by your criterion
4. `gangtise-stock-research` L2 on each of the top 3
5. `gangtise-thematic-research` on the sector as a whole

This is the pattern that `gangtise-stock-selector` and `gangtise-thematic-research` encode internally — knowing the decomposition lets you intervene at any step.

## Credential scope gotchas

The `accessKey + secretAccessKey` you get from Gangtise has **scopes** attached to it. Common scopes (from observation):

- **auth** — can call `loginV2` to mint a token. Every account has this.
- **rag** — can call `knowledge_base` semantic search. Most accounts have this.
- **data** — can call structured data scripts (`quote`, `financial`, `valuation`, etc.). Paid accounts.
- **file** — can call file-center scripts (`report`, `opinion`, `summary`, etc.). Paid accounts.
- **openapi** — aggregate name for the above three. This is what `skills-backend/version?skill=openapi` reports.

If your account is missing a scope, the affected scripts will return an error at call time, not at auth time. `diagnose.sh` probes only the `rag` scope by default (because that's the one most skills need), so a partial-scope account will show "✅ RAG liveness passed" and then fail when you try to call a `data` skill.

**Best practice**: When onboarding a new user, ask their Gangtise admin explicitly: "Does this account have `data` and `file` scopes in addition to `rag`?" If they don't know, the fastest way to find out is to call one of each tier and observe:

```bash
# Tier: rag (should work)
cd ~/.local/share/gangtise-copilot/skills/gangtise-kb-client
python3 scripts/kb.py -q "test" -l 1

# Tier: data (fails if no data scope)
cd ../gangtise-data-client
python3 scripts/quote.py --securities 宁德时代 -sd 2026-04-01 -ed 2026-04-10

# Tier: file (fails if no file scope)
cd ../gangtise-file-client
python3 scripts/report.py -k 宁德时代 -l 3
```

## Working around the OBS LIST block

`gts-download.obs.myhuaweicloud.com/skills/` has its LIST permission disabled (403 on any listing request). This means:

- **You cannot programmatically discover new skills** by crawling the bucket.
- **The installer's bundle list is hand-maintained.**
- **A new Gangtise skill release will not be detected automatically** by the wrapper.

When you hear about a new Gangtise skill (via WeChat, Gangtise's own announcements, or a user report), update `scripts/install_gangtise.sh`:

1. Try to HEAD the new standalone ZIP: `curl -I https://gts-download.obs.myhuaweicloud.com/skills/gangtise-<new-name>.zip`
2. If it returns 200, add it to the bundle map under the appropriate bundle (or under its own standalone line if it's truly independent).
3. Re-test the install flow end-to-end with `--only <new-skill>` to confirm it unpacks cleanly.
4. Add it to the preset lists if it's workshop-relevant.
5. Bump the wrapper version in `marketplace.json` and commit.

## NO_PROXY for macOS / Linux users with local HTTP proxies

If you run a local HTTP proxy (Shadowrocket, Clash, Surge, v2ray, etc.) that intercepts `.com` traffic, every call to `open.gangtise.com` or `gts-download.obs.myhuaweicloud.com` goes through the proxy. Depending on your proxy's TLS handling, this can:

- **Corrupt download responses** (proxy truncates or re-encodes HTTPS bodies) — the installer's size sanity check catches this, but only after a failure.
- **Fail auth calls** (proxy terminates TLS and Gangtise rejects the resulting cert chain).
- **Add 500-2000 ms latency** to every API call, making live demos feel sluggish.

The fix:

```bash
export NO_PROXY="open.gangtise.com,gts-download.obs.myhuaweicloud.com,$NO_PROXY"
export no_proxy="open.gangtise.com,gts-download.obs.myhuaweicloud.com,$no_proxy"
```

Or add these to your shell init (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`). `gangtise-copilot`'s scripts do NOT set this for you — setting NO_PROXY globally is a user-level decision.

## Performance reference

Approximate wall-clock timings for live invocations of each workflow skill (based on staging tests; will vary with query complexity, account quota, and network):

| Skill | Typical wall time | What the audience sees |
|---|---|---|
| `gangtise-stock-research` L1 | 30-60 sec | 1-page MD + rendered HTML |
| `gangtise-stock-research` L2 | 2-4 min | Full investment view MD + HTML |
| `gangtise-stock-research` L3 | 5-10 min | Institutional first-coverage MD + HTML |
| `gangtise-opinion-pk` | 2-4 min | Adversarial analysis MD + HTML |
| `gangtise-thematic-research` | 3-5 min | Theme analysis MD + HTML |
| `gangtise-announcement-digest` | 1-2 min | Stock pool digest MD + HTML |
| `gangtise-event-review` | 1-2 min | Event post-mortem MD + HTML |
| Data-layer call (e.g., `quote.py`) | 3-10 sec | CSV file on disk |

**Demo tip**: Use `gangtise-stock-research` L1 for "hello world" because it's fast enough to not break audience attention, and use L2 for the "wow" moment because the output is institutional-grade but doesn't take so long that you lose the room.

## What NOT to do in a live demo

- **Don't call 18 data-layer scripts in a row.** The audience will see 18 CSV files and think "I could have done this in Excel." Always wrap data calls in a workflow-layer skill.
- **Don't claim the workflow skills are making investment recommendations.** They explicitly avoid this (the compliance guardrails in their templates forbid "买入 / 卖出 / 目标价"). Calling the output a "recommendation" in front of an audience defeats the purpose of the guardrails and puts you at compliance risk.
- **Don't pick `-client` skills before verifying your account has `skills-backend/*` ACL.** If you're affected by ISSUE-007, the `-client` line will fail with `0000001009` mid-demo. Run the diagnostic in `references/known_issues.md` ISSUE-007 first; if you're affected, the legacy minimal line (`gangtise-data`, `gangtise-file`, `gangtise-kb`) is the working surface and they cover the most common queries (OHLC, financials, announcements, RAG retrieval).
- **Don't pair `gangtise-stock-research` with a stock that has sparse coverage.** The workflow needs at least 20 recent research reports + opinions to produce a good L2 output. Pick large-cap A-share names with active analyst coverage for guaranteed data density.
- **Don't demonstrate the `opinion-pk` adversarial analysis on a stock the audience has strong personal opinions about.** It produces a devil's-advocate view by design, which can read as an attack on whoever recommended the stock. Stay with neutral or unfamiliar names.

## What TO do after install

1. **Run `diagnose.sh` once** to confirm everything is healthy (9 checks should pass).
2. **Try one workflow skill on one stock** — pick `gangtise-stock-research L1 宁德时代` as a smoke test. You should get a ~1 minute run and an MD + HTML pair on disk.
3. **Open the HTML in a browser** to see Gangtise's professional report template render. This is the output your workshop audience will see.
4. **Read the MD file's "data sources" section** at the bottom — it lists which underlying skills were called. Use this to build intuition about the workflow → data-layer mapping.
5. **Go back and re-read `skill_registry.md`** with fresh eyes — the capability matrix makes more sense after you've seen one workflow in action.
