## Purpose

Quick reference for any SaaS finance metric without deep teaching. Use this when you need a fast formula lookup, benchmark check, or decision framework reminder. For detailed explanations, calculations, and examples, see the related deep-dive skills.

This is not a teaching tool—it's a cheat sheet optimized for speed. Scan, find, apply.

## Key Concepts

### Metric Categories

Metrics are organized into four families:

1. **Revenue & Growth** — Top-line money (revenue, ARPU, ARPA, MRR/ARR, churn, NRR, expansion)
2. **Unit Economics** — Customer-level profitability (CAC, LTV, payback, margins)
3. **Capital Efficiency** — Cash management (burn rate, runway, OpEx, net income)
4. **Efficiency Ratios** — Growth vs. profitability balance (Rule of 40, magic number)

### When to Use This Skill

**Use this when:**
- You need a quick formula or benchmark
- You're preparing for a board meeting or investor call
- You're evaluating a decision and need to check which metrics matter
- You want to identify red flags quickly

**Don't use this when:**
- You need detailed calculation guidance (use `saas-revenue-growth-metrics` or `saas-economics-efficiency-metrics`)
- You're learning these metrics for the first time (start with deep-dive skills)
- You need examples and common pitfalls (covered in related skills)

### Quick Decision Frameworks

Use these frameworks to combine metrics for common PM decisions.

#### Framework 1: Should We Build This Feature?

**Ask:**
1. **Revenue impact?** Direct (pricing, add-on) or indirect (retention, conversion)?
2. **Margin impact?** What's the COGS? Does it dilute margins?
3. **ROI?** Revenue impact / Development cost

**Build if:**
- ROI >3x in year one (direct monetization), OR
- LTV impact >10x development cost (retention), OR
- Strategic value overrides short-term ROI

**Don't build if:**
- Negative contribution margin even with optimistic adoption
- Payback period exceeds average customer lifetime

**Metrics to check:** Revenue, Gross Margin, LTV, Contribution Margin

---

#### Framework 2: Should We Scale This Acquisition Channel?

**Ask:**
1. **Unit economics?** CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC ratio
2. **Cash efficiency?** Payback period
3. **Customer quality?** Cohort retention, NRR by channel
4. **Scalability?** Magic Number, addressable volume

**Scale if:**
- LTV:CAC >3:1 AND
- Payback <18 months AND
- Customer quality meets/beats other channels AND
- Magic Number >0.75

**Don't scale if:**
- LTV:CAC <1.5:1 AND
- No clear path to improvement

**Metrics to check:** CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC, Payback Period, NRR, Magic Number

---

#### Framework 3: Should We Change Pricing?

**Ask:**
1. **ARPU/ARPA impact?** Will revenue per customer increase?
2. **Conversion impact?** Help or hurt trial-to-paid conversion?
3. **Churn impact?** Create churn risk or reduce it?
4. **NRR impact?** Enable expansion or create contraction?

**Implement if:**
- Net revenue impact positive after churn risk
- Can test with segment before broad rollout

**Don't change if:**
- High churn risk without offsetting expansion
- Can't test hypothesis before committing

**Metrics to check:** ARPU, ARPA, Churn Rate, NRR, CAC Payback

---

#### Framework 4: Is the Business Healthy?

**Check by stage:**

**Early Stage (Pre-$10M ARR):**
- Growth Rate >50% YoY
- LTV:CAC >3:1
- Gross Margin >70%
- Runway >12 months

**Growth Stage ($10M-$50M ARR):**
- Growth Rate >40% YoY
- NRR >100%
- Rule of 40 >40
- Magic Number >0.75

**Scale Stage ($50M+ ARR):**
- Growth Rate >25% YoY
- NRR >110%
- Rule of 40 >40
- Profit Margin >10%

**Metrics to check:** Revenue Growth, NRR, LTV:CAC, Rule of 40, Magic Number, Gross Margin

### Red Flags by Category

#### Revenue & Growth Red Flags
| **Red Flag** | **What It Means** | **Action** |
|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| Churn increasing cohort-over-cohort | Product-market fit degrading | Stop scaling acquisition; fix retention first |
| NRR <100% | Base is contracting | Fix expansion or reduce churn before scaling |
| Revenue churn > logo churn | Losing big customers | Investigate why high-value customers leave |
| Quick Ratio <2 | Leaky bucket (barely outpacing losses) | Fix retention before scaling acquisition |
| Expansion revenue <10% of MRR | No upsell/cross-sell engine | Build expansion paths |
| Revenue concentration >50% in top 10 customers | Existential dependency risk | Diversify customer base |

#### Unit Economics Red Flags
| **Red Flag** | **What It Means** | **Action** |
|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| LTV:CAC <1.5:1 | Buying revenue at a loss | Reduce CAC or increase LTV before scaling |
| Payback >24 months | Cash trap (long cash recovery) | Negotiate annual upfront or reduce CAC |
| Gross margin <60% | Low profitability per dollar | Increase prices or reduce COGS |
| CAC increasing while LTV flat | Unit economics degrading | Optimize conversion or reduce sales cycle |
| Contribution margin <40% | Unprofitable after variable costs | Cut variable costs or increase prices |

#### Capital Efficiency Red Flags
| **Red Flag** | **What It Means** | **Action** |
|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| Runway <6 months | Survival crisis | Raise capital immediately or cut burn |
| Net burn accelerating without revenue growth | Burning faster without results | Cut costs or increase revenue urgency |
| OpEx growing faster than revenue | Negative operating leverage | Freeze hiring; optimize spend |
| Rule of 40 <25 | Burning cash without growth | Improve growth or cut to profitability |
| Magic Number <0.5 | S&M engine broken | Fix GTM efficiency before scaling spend |

### When to Use Which Metric

**Prioritizing features:**
- Revenue impact → Revenue, ARPU, Expansion Revenue
- Margin impact → Gross Margin, Contribution Margin
- ROI → LTV impact, Development cost

**Evaluating channels:**
- Acquisition cost → CAC, CAC by Channel
- Customer value → LTV, NRR by Channel
- Payback → Payback Period, CAC Payback by Channel
- Scalability → Magic Number

**Pricing decisions:**
- Monetization → ARPU, ARPA, ACV
- Impact → Churn Rate, NRR, Expansion Revenue
- Efficiency → CAC Payback (will pricing change affect it?)

**Business health:**
- Growth → Revenue Growth, MRR/ARR Growth
- Retention → Churn Rate, NRR, Quick Ratio
- Economics → LTV:CAC, Payback Period, Gross Margin
- Efficiency → Rule of 40, Magic Number, Operating Leverage
- Survival → Burn Rate, Runway

**Board/investor reporting:**
- Key metrics: ARR, Revenue Growth %, NRR, LTV:CAC, Rule of 40, Magic Number, Burn Rate, Runway
- Stage-specific: Early stage emphasize growth + unit economics; Growth stage emphasize Rule of 40 + Magic Number; Scale stage emphasize profitability + efficiency

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature Investment Sanity Check

You are deciding whether to build a premium export feature.

1. Use Framework 1 (Should We Build This Feature?)
2. Pull baseline metrics: ARPU, Gross Margin, LTV, Contribution Margin
3. Model optimistic, base, and downside adoption
4. Reject if contribution margin turns negative in downside case

Quick output:
- Base case ROI: 3.8x
- Contribution margin impact: +4 points
- Decision: Build now, with a 90-day post-launch check on churn and expansion

### Example 2: Channel Scale Decision

Paid social is generating many signups but weak retention.

1. Use Framework 2 (Should We Scale This Acquisition Channel?)
2. Check CAC, LTV:CAC, Payback Period, and NRR by channel
3. Compare against best-performing channel, not company average

Quick output:
- LTV:CAC: 1.6:1
- Payback: 26 months
- NRR: 88%
- Decision: Do not scale; cap spend and run targeted optimization tests

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Using blended company averages instead of cohort or channel-level metrics
- Scaling acquisition when Quick Ratio is weak and retention is deteriorating
- Treating high LTV:CAC as sufficient without checking payback and runway impact
- Raising prices based on ARPU lift alone without modeling churn and contraction
- Comparing benchmarks across mismatched company stages or business models
- Tracking many metrics without a clear decision question
