# Naming And Structure

## Naming

### Domain Language

Use domain terms over technical names:

```ruby
# Good
class Closure < ApplicationRecord
class Membership < ApplicationRecord
class Publication < ApplicationRecord

# Bad
class CardCloseRecord < ApplicationRecord
class UserMembershipEntry < ApplicationRecord
```

Keep one canonical term per concept across code, APIs, and docs. When a term changes, update call chains — do not add long-lived wrappers.

Every project should document its canonical terms in `docs/domain-terms.md` or
an equivalent project-specific file linked from the README. Keep that document
current when adding, renaming, or deprecating domain terms.

Keep presentation wording separate from domain naming. UI copy may vary for
readability, but models, params, serializers, routes, APIs, persisted fields,
and technical docs should use the canonical term.

### Positive Predicates

Prefer positive predicate names over negative ones:

```ruby
# Good
def active?
  deleted_at.nil?
end

def unassigned?
  assignments.empty?
end

# Bad
def not_deleted?
  deleted_at.nil?
end

def no_assignments?
  assignments.empty?
end
```

### Explicit Method Names

Keep method names explicit. Hidden behavior in methods with generic names leads to surprises.

```ruby
# Good
def process_payment
  charge_card
  send_receipt
  update_inventory
end

# Bad — hidden behavior
def do_thing
  charge_card
  send_receipt
  update_inventory
end
```

## Layering

### Controllers

- Keep controllers thin and orchestration-focused.
- Controllers authenticate, authorize, parse input, delegate, and return response.
- Business logic does not belong in controllers.

```ruby
# Good
class Cards::ClosuresController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @card.close
  end
end

# Bad
class Cards::ClosuresController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @card.transaction do
      @card.create_closure!(user: Current.user)
      @card.events.create!(action: :closed, creator: Current.user)
    end
  end
end
```

### Models

- Keep domain behavior in models and POROs.
- Models expose intention-revealing APIs that controllers call directly.
- POROs live under model namespaces (`Event::Description`, `User::Filtering`).

### Decision Heuristic: Model Method → Concern → PORO

Start simple. Extract only when pain emerges.

```
1. Method on the model          → simple, local
2. Concern (shared behavior)    → same pattern in 3+ models
3. PORO under model namespace   → complex operation, presentation, or view context
4. Separate service class       → only when cross-domain orchestration is truly needed
```

**Rule of three**: Duplicate a pattern twice before abstracting. The third duplication reveals the real boundary.

Avoid importing architecture from other ecosystems when Rails has a direct
convention. Do not add a parallel layer to wrap ordinary model, controller,
job, mailer, route, or view behavior. A new abstraction is justified only when
it removes real duplication, owns a clear domain concept, or coordinates a
cross-domain workflow that does not naturally belong to one model.

Before adding a class, name its responsibility in one sentence. If the class
only forwards calls, renames another object, groups parameters without behavior,
or exists to make a test easier, do not add it.

Prefer model methods for local behavior. Prefer model-namespaced POROs for
cohesive operations that do not fit one Active Record object. Use services only
for true cross-domain orchestration with a stable public API.

### Concerns: When And How

Extract a concern when:

- The same behavior pattern appears across 3+ models or controllers.
- The behavior is cohesive — related associations, scopes, and methods together.
- The concern name describes a capability: `Closeable`, `Watchable`, `Assignable`.

Do NOT extract a concern when:

- Only 1–2 models share it (use a method or callback instead).
- The concern would be a grab-bag of unrelated functionality.
- The main goal is to reduce file size (split responsibilities instead).

```ruby
# Good — cohesive, named for capability
module Card::Closeable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    has_one :closure, dependent: :destroy
    scope :closed, -> { joins(:closure) }
    scope :open, -> { where.missing(:closure) }
  end

  def closed?
    closure.present?
  end

  def close(user: Current.user)
    unless closed?
      transaction do
        create_closure! user: user
        track_event :closed, creator: user
      end
    end
  end
end
```

```

### Controller Alignment

Map controllers to resources. Nested controllers for sub-resources:

```
CardsController                    → /cards
Cards::ClosuresController          → /cards/:card_id/closure
Cards::CommentsController          → /cards/:card_id/comments
Boards::PublicationsController     → /boards/:board_id/publication
```

### Migrations

- Keep migrations additive and reversible where practical.
- Do not reference application models in irreversible data migrations.
- Backfill data in batches for large tables.
- Add indexes for foreign keys, lookup columns, and common query patterns.

## Law of Demeter

Avoid reaching deep into model associations. Chained dot access (`@var.association.association.method`) is a sign of coupling.

### In Views

```ruby
# Bad — 3+ dot chain
@invoice.customer.address.street

# Good — delegate with prefix
class Invoice < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :customer
  delegate :street, :city, :zip, to: :address, prefix: true, allow_nil: true
  # Now: invoice.address_street
end
```

### In Controllers

Access finders through the association proxy, not by crossing boundaries:

```ruby
# Good — scoped through association
@memberships = @user.memberships.recently_active

# Bad — crosses association boundary
@memberships = Membership.where(user: @user, active: true).limit(5)
```

### Rules

- Do not access nested associations in views: `@var.a.b.method` is forbidden.
- Use `delegate :method, to: :association, prefix: true` to flatten access.
- Query through association proxies, not raw `where` on unrelated models.

## Avoid Parallel Names

Do not introduce parallel names for the same concept (e.g., `business` and `category`). When existing parallel names exist, update call chains instead of adding wrappers.
