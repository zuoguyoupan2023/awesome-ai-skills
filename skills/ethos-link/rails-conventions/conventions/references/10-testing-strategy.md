# Testing Strategy

## Minitest Over RSpec

Use Minitest. It ships with Rails, has simpler syntax, faster boot time, and
plain Ruby assertions. Do not add RSpec, factory gems, or third-party mocking
libraries unless the app already uses them.

## Fixtures Over Factories

Use fixtures for deterministic, preloaded test data. Do not add factories.

```yaml
# test/fixtures/users.yml
david:
  identity: david
  account: basecamp
  role: admin

jason:
  identity: jason
  account: basecamp
  role: member
```

**Why fixtures**:
- Loaded once, reused across tests.
- No runtime object creation overhead.
- Relationships are explicit and visible.
- Deterministic IDs for debugging.

Use labels, not IDs, for relationships:

```yaml
# test/fixtures/cards.yml
urgent_bug:
  board: engineering
  creator: david
  title: "Fix login bug"
```

Use ERB for dynamic values:

```yaml
recent_card:
  board: engineering
  creator: david
  created_at: <%= 1.hour.ago %>
```

## Test Structure

### Unit Tests (Models)

```ruby
class CardTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  setup do
    @card = cards(:urgent_bug)
    @user = users(:david)
  end

  test "closing a card creates an event" do
    assert_difference "Event.count", 1 do
      @card.close(user: @user)
    end

    assert @card.closed?
  end

  test "closed cards cannot be edited" do
    @card.close(user: @user)

    assert_not @card.editable_by?(@user)
  end
end
```

### Integration Tests (Controllers)

```ruby
class CardsControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  setup do
    @user = users(:david)
    sign_in_as @user
  end

  test "creating a card" do
    assert_difference "Card.count", 1 do
      post board_cards_path(boards(:engineering)),
        params: { card: { title: "New feature" } }
    end

    assert_redirected_to card_path(Card.last)
  end

  test "unauthorized users cannot delete" do
    sign_in_as users(:guest)

    assert_no_difference "Card.count" do
      delete card_path(cards(:urgent_bug))
    end

    assert_response :forbidden
  end
end
```

### System Tests

Use `data-test-id` selectors for stable, intention-revealing test targets:

```ruby
class CardSystemTest < ApplicationSystemTestCase
  setup do
    sign_in_as users(:david)
  end

  test "dragging card between columns" do
    visit board_path(boards(:engineering))

    card = find("[data-test-id='card-#{cards(:urgent_bug).id}']")
    target = find("[data-test-id='column-doing']")

    card.drag_to(target)

    assert_selector "[data-test-id='column-doing'] [data-test-id='card-#{cards(:urgent_bug).id}']"
  end
end
```

## Test Helpers

```ruby
# test/test_helper.rb
class ActiveSupport::TestCase
  include SignInHelper

  parallelize(workers: :number_of_processors)
  fixtures :all
end
```

## Testing Time

Use `travel_to` for time-dependent tests:

```ruby
test "cards auto-close after inactivity" do
  card = cards(:stale_card)

  travel_to 31.days.from_now do
    Card.auto_close_stale!
    assert card.reload.closed?
  end
end
```

## Testing Jobs

```ruby
test "closing card enqueues notification job" do
  assert_enqueued_with(job: NotifyWatchersJob) do
    cards(:urgent_bug).close(user: users(:david))
  end
end

test "notification job sends emails" do
  perform_enqueued_jobs do
    cards(:urgent_bug).close(user: users(:david))
  end

  assert_emails 3
end
```

## HTTP, VCR, And Webhooks

- WebMock must remain enabled in tests; do not allow live HTTP.
- Outbound API calls use VCR cassettes in `test/support/cassettes/`.
- Cassette naming: `{platform}_{resource}[optional_suffix].yml`.
- Inbound webhooks use JSON captures in `test/support/webhook_captured/` (do not use VCR).

## VCR For External APIs

```ruby
test "fetching provider data" do
  VCR.use_cassette("provider/fetch_reviews") do
    reviews = Provider::Reviews.fetch(business)

    assert_equal 5, reviews.count
  end
end
```

## When Tests Ship

Tests ship with features in the same commit — not beforehand, not afterward. Security fixes always include regression tests.

## Minimum Coverage For Feature Work

- Model/business behavior tests.
- Request/controller integration tests covering happy and sad paths.
- Job enqueue/execution tests.
- System tests for critical user flows when UI changes.

## Test Quality

- Assert behavior and observable outcomes, not framework internals.
- Prefer persisted state, rendered output, delivered mail, enqueued jobs, and
  other real side effects over mocks, stubs, or expectations on framework
  plumbing.
- Controller/system tests must assert response/redirect plus content or side effects.
- Keep fixtures small (~10 records per type) for speed and determinism.
- Do not test private methods directly. If private behavior is hard to reach
  through public behavior, simplify the production design.
- Avoid mocks and stubs for core domain behavior. Use them only at external
  boundaries or when the alternative would make the test slow, flaky, or
  unclear.

## Minitest Mocks

Use `Minitest::Mock` when a test double is justified. Set expectations with
`expect`, exercise the public behavior, and call `verify`.

```ruby
test "notifies provider" do
  provider = Minitest::Mock.new
  provider.expect :deliver, true, [String]

  Notification.new(provider: provider).deliver("Hello")

  provider.verify
end
```

Prefer mocks at external boundaries such as provider clients, mail delivery
adapters, and payment gateways. Do not mock the object under test or its core
domain collaborators just to avoid designing a clearer public API.

## Antipatterns To Avoid

### No `sleep` In Tests

Do not use `sleep` to wait for async behavior. Use `travel_to` for time-dependent tests or event-based waits:

```ruby
# Bad
sleep 2
assert page.has_content?("Done")

# Good
travel_to 2.seconds.from_now do
  assert page.has_content?("Done")
end
```

### No Tests Coupled To HTML Structure

Use `data-test-id` selectors, not CSS class or tag-based selectors:

```ruby
# Bad — breaks when markup changes
find(".card-wrapper > .header > .title")

# Good — stable, intentional selector
find("[data-test-id='card-title']")
```

### No Shared Mutable State Between Tests

Each test must be independent. Do not rely on test execution order:

```ruby
# Bad — depends on previous test
$global_counter ||= 0

# Good — each test is self-contained
test "increments" do
  counter = 0
  assert_equal 1, counter + 1
end
```

### No Stubbing The System Under Test

Do not stub the object you are testing. If stubbing is needed, simplify the production design:

```ruby
# Bad
test "processes order" do
  order = orders(:pending)
  allow(order).to receive(:charge_card).and_return(true)
  # ...
end
```
