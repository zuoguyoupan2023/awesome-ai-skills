# Developer Entry Contract

Up: [index.md](index.md)

This contract defines the minimum developer-entry verification surface required by the post-upstream-governance developer-entry plan.

Scope for this slice:
- Verify the repository exposes a canonical developer-entry path.
- Verify `CONTRIBUTING.md` exists and points contributors to zone, proof, and plan surfaces.
- Verify only documentation and verification entry surfaces.

Out of scope for this slice:
- PR template enforcement
- Canary contributor journey execution
- Runtime/router/install non-regression gates beyond linking to their proof surface

## Contract Semantics

- `root_entry.required_links`: the canonical root README must expose a direct developer-entry jump.
- `developer_entry.required_files`: the downstream governance files that must exist for the entry path to be considered structurally complete.
- `developer_entry.required_links`: the documents that must be reachable directly from `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- `developer_entry.required_marker_groups`: contributor-facing content signals that prove the entry doc is describing zone boundaries and proof expectations, not just linking around them.

## Gate Result Meaning

- `PASS`: the developer-entry path is structurally present and contributor-facing guidance is linked and visible.
- `FAIL`: at least one required file, link, or marker group is missing. This is a documentation and governance gap, not a runtime mutation.

## Evidence Standard

Use the developer-entry gate with the normal proof format:

- Command
- Output
- Claim
