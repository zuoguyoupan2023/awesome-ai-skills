# VCO Changelog Archive: Pre-v2.3.53

This archive volume stores changelog history that no longer needs to stay on the active stable path.

Current changelog surface: `references/changelog.md`.

## v2.3.52 (2026-03-29)
- Landed stage-aware memory activation inside the standard six-stage `vibe` runtime, including per-run memory activation reports and bounded context injection into governed artifacts.
- Added real governed backend adapter read/write paths for `Serena`, `ruflo`, and `Cognee`, with session-local request/response receipts instead of policy-only ownership claims.
- Kept memory-scope boundaries explicit: `ruflo` remains XL-scoped, `knowledge-steward` remains explicit-only, and the runtime cleanup fold is local governed compaction rather than silent skill auto-invocation.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.52.md`.


## v2.3.51 (2026-03-28)

- Integrated downstream delivery acceptance into the normal `vibe` main chain so governed runs now freeze product acceptance semantics, plan delivery checks, and emit a per-run delivery-acceptance report during cleanup.
- Completed the recent specialist-governance sequence on `main`: stage-bound specialist dispatch, child-lane same-round auto-absorb under root approval, and stronger native-specialist failure proofing.
- Fixed Windows specialist runtime handoff so governed specialist execution stays usable on current Windows environments instead of breaking at the boundary between orchestration and native specialist lanes.
- Added benchmark/scenario-backed workflow acceptance and release-truth helpers to support stricter completion-language honesty beyond pure runtime/process success.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.51.md`.


## v2.3.50 (2026-03-26)

- Added router AI connectivity proofing for the governance advice path, including a PowerShell gate, a runtime-neutral Python probe, and install-entry quick-check guidance that reports structured readiness states.
- Hardened LLM acceleration overlay optional-field handling and aligned the default Windows verification command with `powershell.exe` so stock Windows environments can run the router gate without requiring `pwsh`.
- Landed the current host-adapter and install-surface closure now present on main: OpenClaw runtime-core normalization, OpenCode preview adapter/install surface, Cursor/Windsurf preview support alignment, and a single public install entry with bilingual parity.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.50.md`.


## v2.3.49 (2026-03-23)

- Hardened install/check path resolution so PowerShell and shell entrypoints no longer assume deep parent-directory layouts when launched from shallow release worktrees under `/tmp`.
- Added adapter-registry fallback resolution for installed-runtime check surfaces, so `check.ps1` and `check.sh` keep working from pure installed `skills/vibe` roots without repo-level `adapters/index.json`.
- Centralized parent-path and canonical-repo detection helpers, then applied the same guardrails across PowerShell and Python adapter/install tooling to reduce cross-surface divergence.
- Added installed-runtime regression coverage for pure installed-script health checks.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.49.md`.


## v2.3.48 (2026-03-23)

- Normalized legacy `benchmark_autonomous` input to `interactive_governed`, making `interactive_governed` the only effective governed runtime mode while preserving silent compatibility for older callers.
- Updated runtime bridge tests and governed proof gates so the compatibility downgrade is verified explicitly instead of routing legacy mode through unattended execution.
- Hardened `scripts/verify/vibe-adaptive-routing-readiness-gate.ps1` to handle single-file telemetry without crashing the release train.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.48.md`.


## v2.3.47 (2026-03-15)

- Added canonical no-silent-fallback governance plus implementation guardrails so degraded paths must stay explicit, warned, and non-authoritative.
- Added fallback-truth release gates covering silent fallback, self-introduced fallback, and release-truth consistency across runtime, code, and release surfaces.
- Synced routed-stability fixture mirrors back to tracked output truth before release cut, then revalidated output artifact boundary closure.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.47.md`.


## v2.3.46 (2026-03-15)

- Fixed the Linux `benchmark_autonomous` / governed-runtime execution chain so benchmark units no longer hardcode `python` on hosts that only provide `python3`.
- Added platform-neutral Python host resolution through `Resolve-VgoPythonCommandSpec`, supporting `python`, `python3`, and `py -3` without forking runtime truth by host.
- Updated the Linux no-`pwsh` router gate wrapper and benchmark execution policy to consume the shared Python host resolver instead of direct `python` invocations.
- Extended `tests/runtime_neutral/test_governed_runtime_bridge.py` with host-resolution coverage so the governed bridge now proves `python3` fallback and Windows `py -3` launcher behavior.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.46.md`.


## v2.3.45 (2026-03-15)

- Hardened `invoke-vibe-runtime.ps1` so the governed runtime waits for critical execution artifacts to become durable before returning summary output.
- Added artifact-root-relative path fields to the runtime summary, making `benchmark_autonomous` bridge consumers robust under Windows PowerShell path encoding/codepage differences.
- Fixed `tests/runtime_neutral/test_governed_runtime_bridge.py` to reconstruct artifact paths from the temp artifact root when absolute stdout paths are lossy on Windows.
- Revalidated benchmark closure with real execution and proof gates after mirror/version sync.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.45.md`.


## v2.3.44 (2026-03-15)

- Upgraded `benchmark_autonomous` from a receipt-only `plan_execute` placeholder into a bounded local XL executor that writes real execution manifests, per-unit receipts, command logs, and a benchmark proof bundle.
- Added `config/benchmark-execution-policy.json` as the canonical scheduler contract for repo-safe benchmark execution, including wave/unit topology and proof thresholds.
- Strengthened `tests/runtime_neutral/test_governed_runtime_bridge.py` and `scripts/verify/vibe-governed-runtime-contract-gate.ps1` so benchmark mode must now prove real unit execution instead of only artifact existence.
- Added `scripts/verify/vibe-benchmark-autonomous-proof-gate.ps1` to verify that benchmark runtime closure includes actual command execution, zero failed units, and a tracked proof manifest.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.44.md`.

## v2.3.43 (2026-03-15)

- Landed the governed runtime contract as the canonical `vibe` entry: one user-facing path, six fixed stages, and `interactive_governed` / `benchmark_autonomous` runtime modes with internal grades only.
- Added governed-runtime packaging/runtime bridge coverage through `tests/runtime_neutral/test_governed_runtime_bridge.py`, including runtime-contract marker coverage and temp artifact-root closure for `invoke-vibe-runtime.ps1`.
- Extended installed-runtime freshness markers and governed packaging scope so the six-stage runtime surfaces are part of the governed installed-runtime contract rather than repo-only documentation.
- Aligned outward-facing release surfaces, dist manifests, and proof-bundle source-release markers to `v2.3.43`.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.43.md`.


## v2.3.42 (2026-03-14)

- Converted the Linux full-authoritative candidate proof bundle into a truly distributable governed artifact by tracking the frozen `*.log` evidence files instead of letting clean clones silently lose them to `.gitignore`.
- Added `scripts/verify/vibe-proof-bundle-tracked-files-gate.ps1` so manifest-declared proof artifacts, operation records, and fresh-machine reports must all be git-tracked before release truth can be called green.
- Wired the new tracked-files gate into the platform-promotion bundle so `vibe-platform-promotion-bundle.ps1` now fails whenever proof truth depends on author-machine residue.
- Corrected the release-truth mismatch discovered in `v2.3.41`: Linux remains `supported-with-constraints`, but proof/promotion governance is now evaluated against versioned repository contents rather than ignored local leftovers.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.42.md`.

## v2.3.41 (2026-03-14)

- Replaced `USERPROFILE`-only default target-root assumptions across additional official PowerShell entrypoints with the shared platform-aware resolver so Linux + `pwsh` no longer trips on null home-path defaults.
- Added canonical execution-context locking to the Linux proof gate so stale installed-runtime copies fail with an explicit governance hint instead of being misread as repo-root Linux regressions.
- Aligned official-runtime baseline and dist manifests to the governed `2.3.41` release truth while keeping Linux public support status conservative at `supported-with-constraints`.
- Updated high-frequency operator docs to use cross-platform `pwsh` / `<target-root>` guidance instead of Windows-first `USERPROFILE` examples.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.41.md`.


## v2.3.40 (2026-03-14)

- Closed the cross-shell runtime-freshness validation gap so a receipt written by Windows PowerShell install flow can be validated correctly by `check.sh` under bash / WSL.
- Added explicit installed-runtime upgrade hints to `check.ps1` and `check.sh` so repo pulls are no longer silently confused with installed runtime upgrades.
- Kept Linux platform truth conservative while preserving green router, routing-stability, platform-support, mirror-hygiene, and proof-bundle gates.
- Aligned the governed release surface to `2.3.40` across version governance, maintenance markers, release navigation, and public install copy.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.40.md`.

## v2.3.39 (2026-03-14)

- Closed the Linux retest regression around OpenSpec routing by adding the missing `requested_skill_whitelist` contract and hardening the router against missing-policy fields.
- Fixed the installed-runtime freshness recursion failure so default `install.ps1` and `check.ps1` can complete their freshness closure instead of blowing up through call-depth overflow.
- Stabilized governed sub-gate invocation so the no-regression umbrella gate now receives deterministic `exit_code` objects instead of leaking child output shapes.
- Hardened multiple router overlays for strict-mode safety and re-proved installed-runtime routing through a fresh isolated smoke runtime.
- Registered the regression-closure router file set in the official-runtime main-chain policy so governance can distinguish this bounded fix wave from unrelated protected-surface drift.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.39.md`.

## v2.3.38 (2026-03-14)

- Removed author-machine path leakage from governed runtime JSON surfaces by replacing hard-coded user paths in `config/dependency-map.json`, `config/upstream-corpus-manifest.json`, `config/ruc-nlpir-runtime.json`, and `config/batch-e-alias-whitelist.json` with `${CODEX_HOME}` / `${VCO_EXTERNAL_ROOT}` forms.
- Landed matching path-resolution helpers and consumer updates so config tokenization does not regress runtime behavior, including sync/bootstrap/governance flows and Linux-sensitive RUC-NLPIR preflight handling.
- Resynced canonical, bundled, and nested-bundled mirrors, then re-materialized the smoke installed runtime to prove the installed surface matches the new canonical governance state.
- Verified release readiness with zero leaked author-machine paths in the governed config surfaces plus green `vibe-upstream-corpus-manifest-gate.ps1`, `vibe-deep-extraction-pilot-gate.ps1`, `vibe-installed-runtime-freshness-gate.ps1`, and `check.ps1 -Profile full`.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.38.md`.


## v2.3.37 (2026-03-13)

- Promoted `scrapling` into the standard governed `full` install lane so the default full-profile path now carries a concrete local scraping/runtime surface instead of treating it as a purely optional afterthought.
- Updated bootstrap doctor semantics to explicitly distinguish three governed surfaces: `scrapling` as the default full-profile runtime surface, `Cognee` as the default long-term enhancement lane, and `Composio / Activepieces` as prewired but setup-required external action surfaces.
- Expanded the install and onboarding docs across README, cold-start paths, one-shot setup, and host-plugin policy so operators can see the truthful boundary between repo-owned closure and host-managed provisioning.
- Aligned the governed release surface to `2.3.37` across version governance, maintenance markers, changelog, release ledger, and release navigation.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.37.md`.


## v2.3.36 (2026-03-13)

- Hardened the install-facing narrative so `full-featured` now means governed closure of the repository-owned surface, not fake automatic readiness for all host plugins or MCP providers.
- Added bilingual host-plugin policy docs and reusable Windows/Linux full-featured install prompt bundles for operator onboarding.
- Updated `README.md`, `README.en.md`, `docs/one-shot-setup.md`, and cold-start install guides to clearly separate `minimum viable`, `recommended full-featured`, and `enterprise-governed` entry paths.
- Aligned the governed release surface to `2.3.36` across version governance, dist manifests, release notes, and runtime-neutral freshness tests.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.36.md`.


## v2.3.35 (2026-03-13)

- Reserved release cut created during release-surface iteration and superseded by `v2.3.36` before merge.
- No separate user-facing delta should be treated as shipped for `v2.3.35`.


## v2.3.34 (2026-03-13)

- Reframed the README install narrative so “full-featured” now means governed closure of the repo-owned surface, not a fake claim that the whole ecosystem is automatically ready.
- Added explicit operator-facing boundary language for host plugins, plugin-backed MCP surfaces, and provider secrets so incomplete host provisioning resolves to `manual_actions_pending` instead of ambiguous expectations.
- Added cold-start onboarding documents for three install modes: `minimum viable`, `recommended full-featured`, and `enterprise-governed`, with commands, acceptance criteria, and stop rules.
- Wired the new onboarding docs into the main README, English README, docs index, and one-shot setup guide so first-time users can enter through a deterministic path instead of guessing.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.34.md`.


## v2.3.33 (2026-03-13)

- Fixed one-shot bootstrap provider seeding so existing `settings.json` keys are reused instead of triggering misleading `OPENAI_API_KEY not provided` warnings.
- Added operator-facing bootstrap messaging that sets realistic expectations for slow `npm` installs and advisory deprecated warnings during external CLI provisioning.
- Aligned `check.ps1` with `nested_bundled` governance so optional nested mirrors no longer create false bundled-config warnings during deep doctor runs.
- Resynced canonical and bundled mirrors, regenerated `config/skills-lock.json`, and re-cut the governed release surface to `v2.3.33`.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.33.md`.


## v2.3.32 (2026-03-13)

- Added dual-platform full-setup onboarding so README now documents a governed "full-featured" install path for both Windows and Linux / macOS.
- Added `scripts/bootstrap/one-shot-setup.sh` to close the shell-native bootstrap gap with install -> settings seed -> MCP active profile materialization -> deep check.
- Updated deployment and one-shot setup docs to make the full-feature boundary explicit: what the repo can automate, and what still must be provisioned at the host/plugin/secret layer.
- Regenerated `config/skills-lock.json`, resynced canonical and bundled mirrors, and re-cut the governed release surface to `v2.3.32`.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.32.md`.


## v2.3.31 (2026-03-13)

- Completed the governed execution closure for:
  - `docs/plans/2026-03-13-distribution-governance-plan.md`
  - `docs/plans/2026-03-13-post-upstream-governance-repo-convergence-plan.md`
  - `docs/plans/2026-03-13-post-upstream-governance-developer-entry-plan.md`
- Repaired external-corpus fixture parity so `vibe-output-artifact-boundary-gate.ps1` returns green with tracked output mirrors aligned.
- Repaired third-party disclosure canonicalization so `vibe-third-party-disclosure-parity-gate.ps1` no longer misclassifies repository-local document links as undeclared upstream sources.
- Re-cut the governed version surface to `v2.3.31`, resynced canonical and bundled assets, and prepared runtime/install/remote alignment around the new release marker.
- Detailed release notes: `docs/releases/v2.3.31.md`.
