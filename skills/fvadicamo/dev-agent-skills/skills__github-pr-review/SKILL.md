# GitHub PR review

Resolves Pull Request review comments with severity-based prioritization, fix application, and thread replies.

## Current PR

!`gh pr view --json number,title,state,milestone -q '"PR #\(.number): \(.title) (\(.state)) | Milestone: \(.milestone.title // "none")"' 2>/dev/null`

## Core workflow

### 1. Fetch, filter, and classify comments

```bash
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q '.nameWithOwner')
PR=$(gh pr view --json number -q '.number')
LAST_PUSH=$(git log -1 --format=%cI HEAD)

# Inline review comments - filter out replies (keep only originals)
gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/comments?per_page=100 --jq '
  [.[] | select(.in_reply_to_id == null) |
   {id, path, user: .user.login, created_at, body: .body[0:200]}]
'

# PR-level reviews with non-empty body (CodeRabbit sections, Gemini, etc.)
gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/reviews?per_page=100 --jq '
  [.[] | select(.body | length > 0) |
   {id, user: .user.login, state, submitted_at, body: .body[0:500]}]
'
```

**Cross-check review-attached comments**: CodeRabbit's review body states "Actionable comments posted: N". If the general `pulls/$PR/comments` endpoint returns fewer than N new originals from that reviewer, some comments are only available via the review-specific endpoint. Fetch them and merge by comment ID:

```bash
# $REVIEW_ID from the reviews fetch above; $EXPECTED from parsing "Actionable comments posted: N"
gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/reviews/$REVIEW_ID/comments?per_page=100 --jq '
  [.[] | select(.in_reply_to_id == null) |
   {id, path, user: .user.login, created_at, body: .body[0:200]}]
'
```

Deduplicate by `id` before continuing. Comments found only via the review-specific endpoint are valid inline comments and should be treated identically (same classification, same `in_reply_to` reply mechanism).

**Filter new vs already-seen**: compare `created_at`/`submitted_at` with `$LAST_PUSH`. Comments posted after the last push are new. Mark older comments as "previous round" in the summary table.

**Parse CodeRabbit review bodies**: the initial fetch truncates bodies for classification. For reviews from CodeRabbit (`user.login` starts with `coderabbitai`), fetch the full body separately:

```bash
gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/reviews?per_page=100 --jq '
  [.[] | select(.user.login | startswith("coderabbitai")) |
   {id, submitted_at, body}]
'
```

CodeRabbit posts structured `<details>` blocks containing outside-diff, duplicate, and nitpick comments. Each block includes file path, line range, severity, and optionally a "Prompt for AI Agents" with pre-built context. See `references/coderabbit_parsing.md` for full parsing guide.

**Use CodeRabbit AI prompts when available**: if a comment (or the review body) contains a "Prompt for AI Agents" `<details>` block, use it to understand the issue and suggested approach. Always read the actual code before proposing a fix. If the review body contains a "Prompt for all review comments with AI agents" block, read it first for cross-comment context before processing individual comments.

Classify all comments by severity and process in order: CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW.

| Severity | Indicators | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| CRITICAL | `critical.svg`, `_🔒 Security_`, `_🚨 Critical_`, `_🔴 Critical_`, "security", "vulnerability" | Must fix |
| HIGH | `high-priority.svg`, `_⚠️ Potential issue_`, `_🐛 Bug_`, `_⚡ Performance_`, `_🟠 Major_`, "High Severity" | Should fix |
| MEDIUM | `medium-priority.svg`, `_🛠️ Refactor suggestion_`, `_💡 Suggestion_`, "Medium Severity" | Recommended |
| LOW | `low-priority.svg`, `_🧹 Nitpick_`, `_🔧 Optional_`, `_🟡 Minor_`, `_🔵 Trivial_`, `_⚪ Info_`, "style", "nit" | Optional |

When a comment has both a type label and a secondary color badge (e.g., `_💡 Suggestion_ | _🟠 Major_`), the color badge is the **binding** severity and overrides the type-based default.

See `references/severity_guide.md` for full detection patterns (Gemini badges, CodeRabbit emoji, Cursor comments, keyword fallback, related comments heuristics).

### 2. Show review summary table

Before processing, display a structured overview of all comments:

```
| # | ID         | Severity | File:Line          | Type     | Status   | Summary            |
|---|------------|----------|--------------------|----------|----------|--------------------|
| 1 | 123456789  | CRITICAL | src/auth.py:45     | inline   | new      | SQL injection risk |
| 2 | 987654321  | HIGH     | src/db.py:346-350  | outside  | new      | Missing join cond  |
| 3 | 555555555  | HIGH     | src/chunk.py:188   | duplicate| previous | Stale metadata     |
| 4 | 444444444  | LOW      | tests/test_q.py:12 | nitpick  | previous | Naming convention  |
```

- **Type**: `inline`, `outside` (outside diff), `duplicate`, `minor`, `nitpick` (from CodeRabbit sections), or `review` (generic PR-level)
- **Status**: `new` (posted after last push) or `previous` (from earlier rounds)
- Group related comments (same file, same root cause, "also applies to" ranges) and note clusters
- Deduplicate: if the same issue appears both as an inline comment and in a CodeRabbit review body section (e.g., duplicate), keep one entry and note both sources

If there are **more than 10 comments**, suggest saving a review summary to Claude's memory for tracking across sessions. The summary should include: PR number, comment IDs, severity, status (new/addressed/deferred/won't fix), and brief description. This helps maintain continuity when new comments arrive after subsequent pushes.

### 3. Process each comment

For each comment, in severity order:

1. **Show context**: comment ID, severity, file:line, quote
2. **Check for AI prompt**: if CodeRabbit "Prompt for AI Agents" is available for this comment, use it to understand the issue and suggested approach
3. **Check for proposed fix**: if CodeRabbit includes a "Proposed fix" or "Suggested fix" code block, use it as a starting point (but verify correctness)
4. **Read affected code** and propose fix (always read the actual code, even when an AI prompt or proposed fix provides context)
5. **Handle "also applies to"**: if the comment references additional line ranges, include all locations in the fix
6. **Confirm with user** before applying
7. **Apply fix** if approved
8. **Verify ALL issues** in the comment are addressed (multi-issue comments are common)

### 4. Commit changes

Use git-commit skill format. Functional fixes get separate commits, cosmetic fixes are batched:

| Change type | Strategy |
|-------------|----------|
| Functional (CRITICAL/HIGH) | Separate commit per fix |
| Cosmetic (MEDIUM/LOW) | Single batch `style:` commit |

Reference the comment ID in the commit body.

### 5. Reply to threads

#### Inline comments

**Important**: use `--input -` with JSON. The `-f in_reply_to=...` syntax does NOT work.

```bash
COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/comments \
  --input - <<< '{"body": "Fixed in '"$COMMIT"'. Brief explanation.", "in_reply_to": 123456789}'
```

#### Non-inline comments (CodeRabbit review body)

Comments embedded in the review body (outside diff, duplicate, nitpick) do not have inline threads. The GitHub API does not support replying to a review body directly. Post a general PR comment referencing the specific issue:

```bash
gh pr comment $PR --body "Fixed in $COMMIT. Addresses outside-diff comment on file/path.py:346-350."
```

**Reply templates** (no emojis, minimal and professional):

| Situation | Template |
|-----------|----------|
| Fixed | `Fixed in [hash]. [brief description of fix]` |
| Won't fix | `Won't fix: [reason]` |
| By design | `By design: [explanation]` |
| Deferred | `Deferred to [issue/task]. Will address in future iteration.` |
| Acknowledged | `Acknowledged. [brief note]` |

### 6. Run tests and push

Run the project test suite. All tests must pass before pushing. Push all fixes together to minimize review loops.

### 7. Submit review (optional)

After addressing all comments, formally submit a review:

- `gh pr review $PR --approve --body "..."` - all comments addressed, PR is ready
- `gh pr review $PR --request-changes --body "..."` - critical issues remain
- `gh pr review $PR --comment --body "..."` - progress update, no decision yet

### 8. Verify milestone

```bash
gh pr view $PR --json milestone -q '.milestone.title // "none"'
```

If the PR has no milestone, check for open milestones:

```bash
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q '.nameWithOwner')
gh api repos/$REPO/milestones --jq '[.[] | select(.state=="open")] | .[] | "\(.number): \(.title)"'
```

If open milestones exist, inform the user and suggest assigning:

```bash
gh pr edit $PR --milestone "[milestone-title]"
```

Do **not** assign automatically. This is a reminder only.

## Avoiding review loops

When bots (Gemini, Codex, etc.) review every push:

1. **Batch fixes**: accumulate all fixes, push once
2. **Draft PR**: convert to draft during fixes
3. **Commit keywords**: some bots respect `[skip ci]` or `[skip review]`

## Important rules

- **ALWAYS** fetch both inline comments (`pulls/$PR/comments`) and review bodies (`pulls/$PR/reviews`)
- **ALWAYS** cross-check "Actionable comments posted: N" against found originals; fetch `pulls/$PR/reviews/$REVIEW_ID/comments` when count mismatches
- **ALWAYS** parse CodeRabbit review bodies for all section types (outside diff, duplicate, minor, nitpick)
- **ALWAYS** use CodeRabbit "Prompt for AI Agents" as primary context when available
- **ALWAYS** show the review summary table before processing
- **ALWAYS** confirm before modifying files
- **ALWAYS** verify ALL issues in multi-issue comments are fixed, including "also applies to" ranges
- **ALWAYS** run tests before pushing
- **ALWAYS** reply to resolved threads using standard templates
- **ALWAYS** submit formal review (`gh pr review`) after addressing all comments
- **ALWAYS** check milestone at the end and remind if missing
- **ALWAYS** suggest saving a review summary to memory when there are more than 10 comments
- **NEVER** use emojis in commit messages or thread replies
- **NEVER** skip HIGH/CRITICAL comments without explicit user approval
- **NEVER** assign milestone automatically - suggest only
- **Functional fixes** -> separate commits (one per fix)
- **Cosmetic fixes** -> batch into single `style:` commit
- **Duplicate comments** -> treat as higher priority than their label (issue was already flagged before)
- **Related comments** -> group and fix together when they share root cause or file context
