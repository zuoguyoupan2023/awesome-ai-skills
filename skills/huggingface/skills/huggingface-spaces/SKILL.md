# Hugging Face Spaces

Hugging Face Spaces host machine-learning applications. There are 1M+ today; each Space is a git repo. This skill covers creating, building, debugging, and maintaining them.

## 0. Getting ready

Before anything else:

1. Check the `hf` CLI is installed: `which hf`. If not, `pip install -U huggingface_hub`.
2. Check the user is logged in: `hf auth whoami`. If not, ask them to run `! hf auth login` in this session — they'll need a write-scoped token from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens.
3. Note `whoami`'s `canPay` and `isPro` flags — they gate hardware choices below.

The `hf-cli` skill teaches an agent every `hf` command and is the recommended companion to this one. Install it with `hf skills add hf-cli` (add `--claude --global` to install for Claude Code as well, user-level).

## 1. What a Space is

A Space is a git repo with three possible SDKs:

- **Gradio** — most Spaces. Python, fast iteration, supports ZeroGPU.
- **Docker** — arbitrary container. Use when you need a non-Python stack or a pre-built template (Streamlit, Argilla, Shiny, etc. — full list at https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker). Does **not** support ZeroGPU.
- **Static** — plain HTML, or a React/Svelte/Vue project built at deploy time. Use for in-browser ML (transformers.js / WebGPU / WebAssembly / onnxruntime-web), project pages, interactive reports, or Spaces that orchestrate other Spaces. No hardware needed.

### Hardware tiers

Free, no creator cost: **`cpu-basic`** and **`zero-a10g`** (ZeroGPU). Static Spaces are also free and don't need hardware.

**`cpu-basic`** — 2 vCPU / 16 GB. For data viz, API-proxy Spaces, small CPU-bound models.

**ZeroGPU (`zero-a10g`)** — dynamic, per-request GPU allocation on NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (sm_120). Two sizes: `large` (half MIG, 48 GB, 1× quota) and `xlarge` (full, 96 GB, 2× quota). Free for the Space creator; Space visitors consume their own daily quota (~5 min free / 40 min Pro / 60 min Enterprise). **Gradio-only**, **PyTorch-first**. Requires the creator to be on a PRO / Team / Enterprise plan.

**Dedicated GPU** (T4, L4, A10G, L40S, A100, H200) — billed to the Space creator by the hour. List + pricing: `hf spaces hardware`. Only the creator can attach these, and only if `canPay=True`. Use when ZeroGPU genuinely doesn't fit — non-PyTorch main model with heavy init, very-large-model long-context inference, etc.

If a non-PRO user has a use case that wants ZeroGPU, you can still build it: create a `cpu-basic` Space, code the app for ZeroGPU, push, then request a community grant. See [`references/grants.md`](references/grants.md).

## 2. Look for an existing demo first

Before deciding how to build anything, search for prior art:

```bash
hf spaces search "<model name or task>" --sdk gradio --limit 10
```

If someone has built a similar Space, read its `app.py` and `requirements.txt` — that gives you the working pattern. Saves a lot of blind iteration. Mention to the user what you found before committing to an approach.

## 3. Decide SDK and hardware

Follow the user's explicit request first. If they were vague:

- **Default for a public ML demo**: Gradio + ZeroGPU. Use this unless something below applies.
- **The model's only inference path is non-PyTorch** (ONNX / TF / JAX / vLLM as the MAIN model, with heavy init): dedicated GPU.
  - But: marginal non-torch tools (a small ONNX preprocessor, a TF utility) inside a torch-main pipeline are fine on ZeroGPU. The hijack only patches torch; init the non-torch lib inside `@spaces.GPU` and pay the short per-call init cost.
- **Tiny / CPU-bound model, or API-proxy Space**: `cpu-basic` (`hardware`-free isn't applicable to Gradio).
- **Browser-side ML or project page**: Static.
- **Container with non-Python stack**: Docker.

### Sourcing the model

- **GitHub repo** — clone locally to read structure. If it already has a Gradio demo, the minimal viable path is to adapt it onto ZeroGPU (see [`references/zerogpu.md`](references/zerogpu.md)). Otherwise: read the README + inference code, prefer the PyTorch path, estimate VRAM (bf16 ≈ `params_B × 2` GB; 48 GB fits ≤24B params at bf16, or much larger with quantization — see [`references/zerogpu.md`](references/zerogpu.md) for quantization on ZeroGPU).
- **HF model repo** — read its README, follow any linked GitHub.
- **Paper / blog post** — look for an official or unofficial implementation. Don't reimplement unless trivial or the user explicitly asks.
- **Vague request** — search Spaces first; surface results.

If the model genuinely won't fit, check **Inference Providers** as an alternative: see [`references/inference-providers.md`](references/inference-providers.md). This avoids hosting the model at all.

## 4. Create the Space

```bash
hf repos create <namespace>/<name> --type space --space-sdk <gradio|docker|static> \
    [--flavor zero-a10g|cpu-basic|<paid-flavor>] \
    [--secrets KEY=val] [--env KEY=val] \
    --public|--private|--protected \
    --exist-ok
```

- `--space-sdk` is required.
- `--flavor` selects hardware. `zero-a10g` is the (legacy) identifier for ZeroGPU. Omit for `cpu-basic`. Run `hf spaces hardware` for the full paid list and pricing.
- Visibility: `--public` (anyone can view), `--private` (only you), `--protected` (app is reachable but git repo / Files tab is private).
- `--secrets KEY=val` becomes an environment variable inside the Space and is **not** visible to visitors. Use for API keys, gated-repo tokens (`HF_TOKEN=hf_…`), etc. Can also be set later via `hf spaces secrets set <id> KEY=val`.
- `--env KEY=val` is **visible to visitors** — use only for non-sensitive config (`GRADIO_SSR_MODE=false`, `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True`, etc.).

> Note: `hardware:` in the README YAML is silently ignored — hardware is only set via `--flavor` at creation, or later via `hf spaces settings <id> --hardware <name>`.

## 5. Build the app

The Space now exists at `https://huggingface.co/spaces/<namespace>/<name>` but is empty.

### README.md frontmatter

Always required:

```yaml
---
title: ...
emoji: 🚀                # pick something representative
colorFrom: blue          # red|yellow|green|blue|indigo|purple|pink|gray (only these)

startup_duration_timeout: 30m   # default; bump to 1h for big LLMs / heavy downloads
---
```

\* Reasons to use an older Gradio: a custom component pins it, or you're adapting an existing demo and don't want to rewrite for 5.x→6.x breaking changes. If you need a 5.x, pick `5.50.0` (latest of the series; still supports custom components).

### Minimal ZeroGPU Gradio app

```python
import spaces           # MUST come before torch / diffusers / transformers
import torch
import gradio as gr
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("<repo>", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16).to("cuda")

@spaces.GPU(duration=60)
def generate(prompt):
    return pipe(prompt).images[0]

gr.Interface(fn=generate, inputs=gr.Text(), outputs=gr.Image()).launch()
```

Three rules — full treatment in [`references/zerogpu.md`](references/zerogpu.md):

1. **`import spaces` before torch / any CUDA-touching import.** It monkey-patches `torch.cuda.*`; once CUDA is initialized in the main process, it's too late.
2. **Load the model at module scope, `.to("cuda")` eagerly.** ZeroGPU intercepts the call, packs weights to disk, and streams them into VRAM on the first `@spaces.GPU` entry. Lazy loading inside the decorator costs every user.
3. **Decorate the function Gradio binds.** Estimate `duration` to the realistic worst case (smaller = higher queue priority and tighter quota check). For input-dependent runtime, pass a callable.

### requirements.txt

Short version:

- **Do NOT list**: `gradio`, `spaces`, `huggingface_hub` (preinstalled and platform-managed; pinning them causes resolution failures or silently breaks the ZeroGPU runtime).
- **Do list if you use them**: `torchvision`, `torchaudio` (not preinstalled), plus everything else (`diffusers`, `transformers`, `accelerate`, `sentencepiece`, …).
- ZeroGPU only accepts torch `2.8.0`, `2.9.1`, `2.10.0`, `2.11.0`. Default to leaving torch unpinned (the runtime preinstalls the latest). Only pin when a dep forces it.
- For prebuilt CUDA-extension wheels (`flash_attn`, `xformers`, `pytorch3d`, `nvdiffrast`, `diff_gaussian_rasterization`, `torchmcubes`): use the prebuilt Blackwell wheels at `https://huggingface.co/datasets/multimodalart/zerogpu-blackwell-wheels/tree/main/wheels`. Full mapping + caveats in [`references/requirements.md`](references/requirements.md).

### Per-SDK depth

- **Gradio patterns** (themes, `gr.Examples`, streaming, custom HTML components, `gr.Server`): [`references/gradio.md`](references/gradio.md).
- **Docker**: https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker. Examples: `hf spaces list --filter docker`.
- **Static**: https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-static. For built SPAs, set `app_build_command: npm run build` and `app_file: dist/index.html` in frontmatter.
- **ZeroGPU specifics** (decorator semantics, sizing, AoTI, generators, concurrency, pickle / `gr.State` across the worker boundary): [`references/zerogpu.md`](references/zerogpu.md) — read this whenever the Space targets ZeroGPU.


## 6. Iterate on the Space, not locally

Try to build a release candidate from the user quest locally and push it — then use the live URL as your test loop. The Space environment is the only one that matters; do not try to test locally. `python3 -m py_compile app.py` is the maximum local check worth doing before pushing.

Once pushed, pick the cheapest update mechanism for each change — hot-reload for pure Python edits, `hf upload` for code-only files hot-reload can't touch, full rebuild only when `requirements.txt` / `Dockerfile` / README frontmatter actually changed. Full ladder + footguns (hot-reload poisoning factory reboot, runtime.sha lag, etc.) in [`references/debugging.md`](references/debugging.md).

## 7. Verify

Don't trust `RUNNING` alone — the app can be running but broken. Four steps, in order:

**A. Alive?** Stage + hardware:
```bash
hf spaces info <ns>/<name> --expand runtime
```

**B. Logs clean post-boot?** Read the run log to confirm startup finished without warnings or silent fallbacks:
```bash
hf spaces logs <ns>/<name> --tail 200
```
Look for model-load completion, no import warnings, no "falling back to CPU" / dtype downgrade messages, no `RUNNING` masking a half-broken app.

**C. API actually responds.** With logs still tailing in another terminal (`hf spaces logs <ns>/<name> --follow`), call the endpoint:
```python
from gradio_client import Client, handle_file
import os
c = Client("<ns>/<name>", token=os.environ["HF_TOKEN"], httpx_kwargs={"timeout": 600})
print(c.view_api())                    # discover endpoints — don't guess
result = c.predict(..., api_name="/generate")
```

**D. Sniff output AND logs.** HTTP 200 ≠ correct output. Check both:
```python
head = open(result, "rb").read(16)
# glTF / \x89PNG / RIFF…WEBP / RIFF…WAVE / [4:8]==b"ftyp" → png/jpg/webp/wav/mp4
```
And look at the run log emitted during the call — silent fallbacks (model snapping to a different size, missing optional dep, dtype downgrade) only show up there.

Full smoke-test patterns (streaming endpoints, OAuth-gated Spaces, `gr.Server` custom routes): [`references/debugging.md`](references/debugging.md).

## 8. Permanent storage (buckets)

Spaces are stateless — `/data` is wiped on restart. If the Space needs to persist user uploads, generations, logs, or interact with a long-lived store, mount a **bucket**:

```bash
hf buckets create <ns>/<bucket-name>                                          # --private optional
hf spaces volumes set <ns>/<space> -v hf://buckets/<ns>/<bucket-name>:/data   # read-write at /data
```

Buckets are paid storage; check `canPay` and confirm with the user. Full patterns (read-fast / write-durable, public bucket URLs, model-cache anti-pattern): [`references/buckets.md`](references/buckets.md).

## 9. When things break

Order of operations:

1. Read the logs: `hf spaces logs <id> --build --follow` (build error) or `hf spaces logs <id> --follow` (runtime error). Find the **first** error, not the last.
2. Grep [`references/known-errors.md`](references/known-errors.md) for the error string. Check if this is a known issue before trying your own fix — most common ZeroGPU / Gradio / dependency errors have a 1–2 line fix there.
3. Iterate using the cheapest rung from [`references/debugging.md`](references/debugging.md). The vast majority of issues resolve with log-reading + smoke-test loops; interactive dev mode + SSH is a heavy-hammer last resort.

If you solve an error that wasn't in the known-errors list, suggest the user PR it back to this skill so future runs benefit.
