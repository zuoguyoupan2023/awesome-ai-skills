## Brand Context (Auto-Applied)

Before producing any marketing output from this module:

1. **Check session context** — The active brand summary was output at session start. Use the brand name, industry, voice settings, channels, goals, compliance, and competitors shown there.
2. **If you need the full profile**, read: `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/profile.json`
3. **Apply brand voice** — Formality, energy, humor, authority levels must shape all content tone and word choices
4. **Check compliance** — Auto-apply rules for brand's target_markets and industry using `skills/context-engine/compliance-rules.md`
5. **Reference industry benchmarks** — Consult `skills/context-engine/industry-profiles.md` for the brand's industry
6. **Use platform specs** — Reference `skills/context-engine/platform-specs.md` for character limits and format requirements
7. **Check campaign history** — Run `python campaign-tracker.py --brand {slug} --action list-campaigns` before planning new work
8. **If no brand exists**, say: "No brand profile found. Use /digital-marketing-pro:brand-setup to create one, or I can proceed with general best practices."
9. **Check brand guidelines** — If `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/guidelines/_manifest.json` exists, load and enforce: `restrictions.md` for banned words, restricted claims, and mandatory disclaimers; `channel-styles.md` for channel-specific tone overrides (may differ from base voice); `messaging.md` for approved key messages, taglines, and positioning language; `voice-and-tone.md` for detailed voice rules beyond the 4 numeric scores. If producing content for a specific channel, channel style rules take precedence over base voice settings.

Do not ask the user for information that already exists in their brand profile.

## Required Context

Before executing content work, gather:

1. **Content Type**: Which specific content format is needed?
2. **Audience**: Who is this content for? (Link to personas from Audience Intelligence if available)
3. **Objective**: What should this content achieve? (Traffic, conversions, engagement, education, retention)
4. **Brand Voice**: Does a brand voice guide exist? What is the tone? (Professional, casual, authoritative, playful, etc.)
5. **Keywords/Topics**: For SEO content — target keywords, search intent, and competitive landscape
6. **Platform**: Where will this content live? (Platform-specific requirements matter)
7. **Funnel Stage**: Where does this content fit in the customer journey?
8. **Existing Content**: What related content already exists? (Avoid cannibalization)
9. **Constraints**: Word count limits, character limits, regulatory disclaimers, brand guidelines
10. **Performance Benchmarks**: What does success look like for this content type?

For quick requests (e.g., "write me a LinkedIn post"), infer reasonable defaults and deliver immediately. For strategic content work, gather full context.

## Process

**Primary Workflow: Content Creation**

1. **Content Strategy Alignment**
   - Confirm the content type, audience, objective, and funnel stage
   - Check for existing content that may overlap (prevent cannibalization)
   - Identify the core message and key takeaway
   - Select the appropriate content framework for the task

2. **Research & Preparation**
   - For SEO content: Analyze target keyword, search intent, SERP features, and top-ranking content
   - For ad copy: Review platform specs, competitor ads, and audience pain points
   - For email: Identify the sequence trigger, desired action, and subscriber segment
   - For social: Check platform trends, optimal formats, and audience behavior patterns
   - For landing pages: Identify the traffic source, visitor intent, and conversion goal

3. **Content Creation**
   - Apply the brand voice guidelines (or establish them if none exist)
   - Write to the specific format requirements (character limits, structure, platform norms)
   - Build in persuasion architecture:
     - **Attention**: Hook/headline that stops the scroll or earns the click
     - **Interest**: Problem-aware framing that demonstrates understanding
     - **Desire**: Solution positioning with clear benefits and social proof
     - **Action**: Clear, specific CTA with reduced friction
   - Include SEO elements where applicable (keywords, headers, internal links, meta data)
   - Write multiple variations for testing when the format supports it (ad copy, subject lines, CTAs)

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Brand voice alignment check
   - Readability score assessment (aim for grade 8 or below for general audiences)
   - Accessibility review (heading hierarchy, alt text guidance, link text clarity)
   - Fact-checking for any claims, statistics, or references
   - Platform compliance check (ad policies, character limits, format requirements)
   - SEO on-page audit (keyword placement, meta data, internal links) for search content
   - AI content quality check if AI-assisted (originality, brand alignment, factual accuracy)

5. **Optimization & Testing Plan**
   - Define what to A/B test (headlines, CTAs, email subject lines, ad creative)
   - Set performance benchmarks based on content type and channel
   - Schedule content review dates for decay monitoring
   - Plan content repurposing across formats and channels

**Secondary Workflow: Content Audit & Refresh**

1. Pull content inventory (URLs, publish dates, current traffic/rankings)
2. Score each piece on freshness, performance trend, and relevance
3. Categorize: Keep (performing well), Refresh (declining but fixable), Consolidate (thin/overlapping), Remove (irrelevant/harmful)
4. Prioritize refresh candidates by traffic recovery potential
5. Create refresh briefs with specific update instructions

## Edge Cases

### Regulated Industry Content (Disclaimers Required)
- **Situation**: Healthcare, financial services, legal, insurance, cannabis, gambling, or other industries requiring mandatory disclaimers, disclosures, or compliance language
- **Approach**: Flag the regulatory requirement at the start of content creation. Include placeholder disclaimer text and recommend legal review before publication. For ad platforms, note specific policy restrictions (e.g., Facebook financial services disclaimers, Google healthcare ad policies). Never present marketing content as compliant without legal review — always recommend professional compliance verification. Keep marketing copy and compliance language visually distinct.

### Multilingual Campaigns
- **Situation**: Content needs to work across multiple languages and cultural contexts
- **Approach**: Write source content with localization in mind (avoid idioms, cultural references, humor that won't translate). Create a localization brief alongside the content that flags culturally sensitive elements. Do not use machine translation for final deliverables — recommend professional translators with marketing expertise. For RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi), flag layout implications for design teams. Account for text expansion (German text is ~30% longer than English) in character-limited formats.

### Content Cannibalization
- **Situation**: Multiple pages competing for the same keyword or covering the same topic
- **Approach**: Audit existing content before creating anything new. If cannibalization exists, recommend consolidation (merge weaker pages into a single strong one) rather than creating yet another competing piece. Use canonical tags, internal linking, and content differentiation to resolve existing cannibalization. When creating new content, check keyword and topic overlap with the existing inventory.

### AI-Generated Content Disclosure
- **Situation**: User wants to publish AI-generated content and needs guidance on disclosure
- **Approach**: Recommend transparency. Note that platform policies are evolving (Google does not penalize AI content but values quality; some social platforms require AI disclosure). Always recommend human review and editing of AI-generated drafts. Flag that pure AI-generated content without human oversight risks factual errors, brand inconsistency, and audience trust issues. Provide the quality assurance checklist for AI-assisted content.

### Accessibility for Video/Audio Content
- **Situation**: Content includes video, audio, or interactive elements needing accessibility treatment
- **Approach**: Recommend captions (not auto-generated — accuracy matters) for all video content. Provide audio descriptions for visual-only information in videos. Create transcripts for podcasts and audio content. Ensure interactive elements are keyboard-navigable. Test with screen readers. Follow WCAG 2.1 AA at minimum, with AAA as a stretch goal for public-facing content.

### RTL Languages
- **Situation**: Content in Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, Urdu, or other right-to-left languages
- **Approach**: Flag RTL implications early in the process. Content structure, CTA placement, and visual hierarchy all reverse. Numbers and embedded Latin text remain LTR within RTL context (bidirectional text). Recommend native-speaker review for all RTL content. Design templates must support RTL layouts. Test email templates in RTL mode specifically, as many email clients handle RTL inconsistently.
