# /digital-marketing-pro:continuous-improvement-loop — Part 12 Continuous Loop

Part 12 is the continuous improvement loop that runs alongside live operations from go-live onwards. It aggregates market signals and operating signals into recommendations that feed back into the brand's product, offering, and service decisions.

## Context efficiency

Heavy skill. **Grep before Read** any referenced file, then `Read` only matched ranges with `offset` + `limit`. List `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/<brand>/` before opening files. On re-invocation mid-session, skip files already in context.

This is **not a one-time activity**. It runs perpetually once Part 11 is complete, with formal output at each Quarterly Business Review (QBR) and ad-hoc output when significant signals warrant.

## Why this exists

Without an explicit feedback loop, marketing operates on assumptions made months ago. Markets shift, customers evolve, competitors move, products are refined — but if these shifts do not flow back into the strategy, the engagement silently grows stale.

Part 12 closes the loop:

- Market signals → strategy refresh
- Operating signals → tactical optimisation
- Product / offering signals → recommendations to product / business teams

## The 4 Signal Sources

### Source 1: Quarterly Business Reviews

Every quarterly review (per [reporting-cadence.md](../context-engine/reporting-cadence.md)) generates structured signals:

- KPIs vs targets (which targets were missed; which were beaten; pattern across quarters?)
- Channel-mix performance (any channel consistently outperforming or underperforming the v2 plan?)
- Audience segment performance (any segment showing different behaviour than the personas predicted?)
- Competitive shifts (any competitor moves that materially change the landscape?)
- Strategy alignment audit (is what we are executing still what the v2 strategy says we should be executing?)

### Source 2: Customer Feedback Themes

Feedback from across customer touchpoints:

- Customer service tickets (volume by topic, sentiment trend)
- ORM (Online Reputation Management) — review sites, social mentions
- Sales team conversations (objections heard repeatedly, requests not yet met)
- Customer journey friction observations (where customers drop off, where they ask for help)
- Survey / NPS responses
- Customer interviews

### Source 3: Competitive Intelligence

From the ongoing competitor monitoring (existing `/digital-marketing-pro:competitor-monitor` skill):

- Product / offering shifts at competitors
- Pricing changes
- Positioning shifts (messaging, target audience)
- New entrant emergence
- Acquisitions / partnerships changing the competitive landscape

### Source 4: Team-Discovered Patterns

Insights from execution that the team surfaces:

- Campaigns that consistently underperform — may indicate product-market mismatches
- Audiences requesting features the product does not yet offer
- Conversion friction points that recur across many campaigns
- Channel performance patterns that suggest the buyer journey has shifted

## Cadence

Part 12 is active continuously, with structured outputs:

| Cadence | Trigger | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Daily / weekly** | Automated signal capture as part of normal operations | Signals logged to `part-12-continuous-improvement/signals.jsonl` |
| **Monthly** | Monthly performance report | "Signals This Month" section in the report; logged to signals.jsonl |
| **Quarterly** | QBR | Structured Part 12 deliverable — see below |
| **Ad-hoc** | Significant signal (e.g., competitor product shift, sales team flagging recurring objection, KPI suddenly cratering) | Ad-hoc Part 12 brief produced within 1 week |

## The Quarterly Part 12 Deliverable

Each quarter, the continuous loop produces a structured deliverable for the brand business owners — not just marketing leadership.

# Quarterly Product & Offering Improvement Brief — {Quarter}

## Executive Summary

(3-5 sentences. The signals that matter most. The recommendations that follow.)

## Signal Aggregation

### Market signals
{Macro market shifts observed in the quarter}

### Customer signals
{Aggregated themes from customer feedback, ORM, sales conversations}

### Competitive signals
{Competitor moves that warrant response or reflection}

### Operating signals
{Patterns from execution — campaigns that under/outperformed; audience surprises; channel shifts}

## Implications

### For the brand strategy
{What in the v2 strategy looks confirmed by the quarter? What looks weakened? Anything that warrants v2.x update-back?}

### For the channel mix
{Any channel reweighting recommended?}

### For the product / offering
{This is the unique Part 12 contribution. What signals suggest the product or offering itself should change?}

## Recommendations

### To the marketing team
{Tactical adjustments — typically already in flight from monthly optimisation, but formalised here}

### To the product / business team
{The substantive Part 12 output — recommendations about product, offering, pricing, distribution that flow from marketing's vantage point}

### To leadership
{Strategic considerations that span functions}

## Triggers for v2.x Update-Back

(If any of the signals warrant a source-document version bump per the [update-back-rule.md](../context-engine/update-back-rule.md), list them here. The actual update-back happens via /digital-marketing-pro:engagement update-back.)

## Open Questions Raised This Quarter

## The Ad-hoc Part 12 Brief

When a significant signal lands between QBRs, the loop produces an ad-hoc brief:

- A competitor launches a product that materially threatens the brand's positioning
- A regulatory change affects the addressable market
- A KPI suddenly drops outside the conservative scenario floor
- The sales team flags an objection that has appeared in 5+ deals in 2 weeks
- A piece of content unexpectedly goes viral, creating a unique moment

Ad-hoc briefs are short (1–3 pages), fast (within a week of the signal), and action-oriented (recommend a specific response).

Output location:
```
engagements/{id}/part-12-continuous-improvement/ad-hoc-briefs/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}.md
```

## Production Process

### For Quarterly Part 12 deliverable

1. **Trigger:** the quarter ends; QBR is being prepared
2. **Read inputs:**
   - All monthly performance reports for the quarter
   - Signals logged in `signals.jsonl` for the quarter
   - Competitor monitoring outputs for the quarter
   - Customer feedback aggregations
   - Living Project Instruction File (current truth)
3. **Aggregate signals** into the four categories
4. **Synthesise implications** for strategy, channels, and product/offering
5. **Draft recommendations** for marketing, product/business, leadership
6. **Identify v2.x update-back triggers** if any
7. **Save** to `quarterly-briefs/`
8. **Update LIF** with quarter's verdict + recommendations
9. **Brief:** "Quarterly Improvement Brief produced. {N} signals aggregated. {N} recommendations. {N} update-back triggers identified — review and run /digital-marketing-pro:engagement update-back if approved."

### For ad-hoc Part 12 brief

1. **Trigger:** significant signal observed (logged with timestamp + source)
2. **Confirm significance** with engagement owner before producing the brief (avoid noise-driven ad-hoc briefs)
3. **Read targeted inputs** relevant to the specific signal
4. **Draft 1–3 page brief** with: signal, evidence, implications, recommended response, decision deadline
5. **Save** to `ad-hoc-briefs/`
6. **Distribute** per engagement's approval chain — typically marketing leadership + relevant product / business stakeholder

## Signal Capture Mechanism

The plugin captures signals continuously via:

- **Daily performance pulls** (when configured) flag anomalies
- **Monthly report production** captures "Insights & Learnings" entries
- **Competitor monitor** flags significant changes
- **Manual capture** via `/digital-marketing-pro:engagement signal --source <source> --signal "<description>"` (custom command — uses the engagement-state.py lif-log-change pattern)

All signals append to `signals.jsonl`:

```json
{"timestamp":"...","source":"customer_feedback","signal":"3 sales reps reported customers asking for X integration","severity":"medium"}
{"timestamp":"...","source":"competitor_monitor","signal":"Competitor Y launched freemium tier","severity":"high"}
{"timestamp":"...","source":"performance_anomaly","signal":"LinkedIn CPL dropped 35% week over week","severity":"high","investigate":true}
```

## Quality Discipline

1. **Signals are evidenced.** No vague "the team feels" — cite the source (which sales rep, which review platform, which monitoring run, which performance metric).
2. **Recommendations are specific.** "Marketing should optimise" is useless. "Reduce LinkedIn brand-awareness budget by 20%, redeploy to retargeting + email lifecycle" is actionable.
3. **Product / offering recommendations are framed as suggestions, not demands.** Marketing's vantage point is one of several inputs to product decisions.
4. **Update-back triggers are flagged but not auto-executed.** The `/digital-marketing-pro:engagement update-back` command is invoked separately after explicit approval.
5. **The audience for quarterly briefs is leadership, not marketing alone.** Write for that audience.

## Examples

### Example 1: Quarterly Part 12 brief

```
User: Q2 ended last week. Produce the quarterly improvement brief.

Skill response:
1. Read all monthly reports for Q2 (April, May, June)
2. Read signals.jsonl entries for Q2 (87 signals captured)
3. Read competitor monitor outputs (3 significant changes)
4. Read customer feedback aggregation (47 reviews + 12 sales-rep notes)
5. Aggregate into 4 signal categories
6. Identify implications:
   - Strategy: v2 positioning held up — confirmed by 12 customer testimonials echoing the positioning language
   - Channels: LinkedIn over-performed (CPL 30% below moderate scenario); Meta under-performed (CPL 40% above)
   - Product: 8 customer signals + 4 sales-rep notes suggest Feature X is consistently asked for
7. Recommendations:
   - Marketing: shift 25% of Meta budget to LinkedIn next quarter
   - Product: prioritise Feature X for Q3 roadmap (8 named customer asks)
   - Leadership: consider a freemium tier (competitor moved here; 5 sales-rep notes about price-sensitive prospects)
8. Identify update-back triggers: Core Doc 3.4 (channel mix) needs v2.1 to reflect LinkedIn's higher allocation
9. Save quarterly-briefs/2026-Q2-quarterly-improvement-brief.md (~8 pages)
10. Brief: "Q2 Improvement Brief produced. 1 update-back trigger flagged. Run /digital-marketing-pro:engagement update-back --doc 3.4 --reason 'Q2 evidence: LinkedIn outperformed; Meta underperformed; recommend channel reweight' after leadership approval."
```

### Example 2: Ad-hoc brief

```
User: Three customers in the past two weeks have switched to a competitor that just launched a freemium tier. We need a fast read on this.

Skill response:
1. Confirm significance with engagement owner ✓
2. Read inputs: the 3 churn cases, competitor monitor on the competitor's freemium launch, last 90 days of churn data for pattern check
3. Draft brief:
   - Signal: 3 churns to Competitor Y in 14 days; pattern check shows churn rate to Y up 4x vs prior 90 days
   - Evidence: churn interview notes (2 of 3 cited price); Competitor Y launched freemium 2026-04-15
   - Implications: short-term — defensive offer for at-risk segment; long-term — pricing strategy review warranted
   - Recommended response: (1) marketing — defensive offer to current at-risk customers within 7 days; (2) product/leadership — assess freemium response within 30 days
   - Decision deadline: response plan by 2026-05-12
4. Save ad-hoc-briefs/2026-05-05-competitor-y-freemium-response.md (2 pages)
5. Distribute per approval chain
```
