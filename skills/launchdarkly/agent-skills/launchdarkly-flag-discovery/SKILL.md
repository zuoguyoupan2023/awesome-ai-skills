# LaunchDarkly Flag Discovery

You're using a skill that will guide you through auditing and understanding the feature flag landscape in a LaunchDarkly project. Your job is to explore the project, assess the health of its flags, identify what needs attention, and provide actionable recommendations.

## Prerequisites

This skill requires the remotely hosted LaunchDarkly MCP server to be configured in your environment.

**Required MCP tools:**
- `list-flags`: search and browse flags with filtering by state, type, tags
- `get-flag`: get full configuration for a single flag in a specific environment
- `get-flag-status-across-envs`: check a flag's lifecycle status across all environments

**Optional MCP tools (enhance depth):**
- `find-stale-flags`: find flags that are candidates for cleanup, sorted by staleness
- `get-flag-health`: get combined health view for a single flag (merges status + config)
- `check-removal-readiness`: detailed safety check for a specific flag

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Project

Before diving into flag data, establish context:

1. **Identify the project.** Confirm the `projectKey` with the user. If they haven't specified one, ask.
2. **Understand scope.** Ask the user what they're trying to accomplish:
   - Broad audit? ("What's the state of our flags?")
   - Targeted investigation? ("Is this specific flag still needed?")
   - Cleanup planning? ("What flags can we remove?")

### Step 2: Explore the Flag Landscape

Adapt your approach to the user's goal:

**For a broad audit:**
- Use `list-flags` scoped to a critical environment (default to `production`).
- Note the total count: this tells you the scale of the flag surface area.
- Filter by `state` (active, inactive, launched, new) to segment the landscape.
- Filter by `type` (temporary vs permanent): temporary flags are the primary cleanup targets.

**For cleanup planning:**
- Use `find-stale-flags`: this is the most efficient entry point. It returns a prioritized list of cleanup candidates sorted by staleness, categorized as:
  - `never_requested`: created but never evaluated (possibly abandoned)
  - `inactive_30d`: no SDK evaluations in the specified period
  - `launched_no_changes`: fully rolled out, no recent changes
- Default `inactiveDays` is 30. Increase for conservative cleanup (60, 90) or decrease for aggressive cleanup (7, 14).
- Default `includeOnly` is `temporary`. Set to `all` to include permanent flags.

**For a targeted investigation:**
- Use `get-flag-health` for a single-flag deep dive. It merges status data with configuration context in one call, returning lifecycle state, last-requested timestamp, targeting summary, age, and whether it's temporary.
- Or use `get-flag` for the full configuration including rules, targets, and fallthrough details.

### Step 3: Assess Flag Health

For flags that need deeper investigation, assess health signals. See [Flag Health Signals](references/flag-health-signals.md) for the full interpretation guide.

Key signals to evaluate:

| Signal | What it tells you |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Lifecycle state** | Where the flag is in its journey (new -> active -> launched -> inactive) |
| **Last requested** | When an SDK last evaluated this flag: staleness indicator |
| **Targeting complexity** | Number of rules and targets: removal complexity indicator |
| **Cross-environment consistency** | Whether the flag behaves the same everywhere |
| **Flag age + temporary status** | Old temporary flags are strong cleanup candidates |

Use `get-flag-status-across-envs` to check if a flag is consistent across environments. A flag inactive in production but active in staging tells a different story than one inactive everywhere.

### Step 4: Categorize and Prioritize

Group flags into actionable categories:

1. **Ready to remove**: Inactive everywhere, temporary, no dependencies. Direct the user to the [flag cleanup skill](../launchdarkly-flag-cleanup/SKILL.md) for code removal.
2. **Likely safe, needs verification**: Launched (fully rolled out), no rule changes recently. The user should confirm the rollout is intentionally complete.
3. **Needs investigation**: Active in some environments but not others, or has complex targeting. Don't recommend action without more context.
4. **Leave alone**: Active flags doing their job, or permanent flags that are intentionally long-lived.

### Step 5: Assess Removal Readiness (When Applicable)

If the user wants to know whether a specific flag can be removed, use `check-removal-readiness`. This tool orchestrates multiple API calls in parallel and returns a structured verdict:

- **`safe`**: No blockers or warnings. Proceed with cleanup.
- **`caution`**: Warnings exist (code references, expiring targets, permanent flag type). Present and let the user decide.
- **`blocked`**: Hard blockers (dependent flags, active requests, targeting rules). Must resolve first.

See [Removal Readiness Checklist](references/removal-readiness-checklist.md) for the full details on interpreting each signal.

### Step 6: Present Findings

Structure your response based on what the user asked for:

**For audits:** Lead with a summary (total flags, breakdown by state and type), then highlight what needs attention, then provide specific recommendations.

**For specific flags:** Lead with the verdict (healthy / needs attention / ready to remove), then support it with the signals you found.

**For cleanup planning:** Lead with the count of cleanup candidates, prioritize by confidence (safest removals first), and link to the cleanup workflow for execution.

## Important Context

- **"Launched" means fully rolled out**: targeting is on, a single variation is served to everyone, and no changes have been made recently. It doesn't mean "recently deployed."
- **"Inactive" doesn't always mean safe to remove.** The flag might be used in code that hasn't shipped yet, or referenced as a prerequisite by another flag.
- **Permanent flags can be inactive on purpose.** Some flags are designed to be dormant until needed (kill switches, emergency toggles). Don't automatically flag these for cleanup.
- **Weights are scaled by 1000 in the API.** A weight of `60000` means 60%. Always convert to human-readable percentages.
- **This skill is for discovery, not action.** If the user wants to remove a flag from code, direct them to the [flag cleanup skill](../launchdarkly-flag-cleanup/SKILL.md). If they want to change targeting, direct them to the [flag targeting skill](../launchdarkly-flag-targeting/SKILL.md).
