# Research & Documentation

Enables comprehensive research workflows: search for information across your Notion workspace, fetch and analyze relevant pages, synthesize findings, and create well-structured documentation.

## Quick Start

When asked to research and document a topic:

1. **Search for relevant content**: Use `Notion:notion-search` to find pages
2. **Fetch detailed information**: Use `Notion:notion-fetch` to read full page content
3. **Synthesize findings**: Analyze and combine information from multiple sources
4. **Create structured output**: Use `Notion:notion-create-pages` to write documentation

## Research Workflow

### Step 1: Search for relevant information

```
Use Notion:notion-search with the research topic
Filter by teamspace if scope is known
Review search results to identify most relevant pages
```

### Step 2: Fetch page content

```
Use Notion:notion-fetch for each relevant page URL
Collect content from all relevant sources
Note key findings, quotes, and data points
```

### Step 3: Synthesize findings

Analyze the collected information:

- Identify key themes and patterns
- Connect related concepts across sources
- Note gaps or conflicting information
- Organize findings logically

### Step 4: Create structured documentation

Use the appropriate documentation template (see [reference/format-selection-guide.md](reference/format-selection-guide.md)) to structure output:

- Clear title and executive summary
- Well-organized sections with headings
- Citations linking back to source pages
- Actionable conclusions or next steps

## Output Formats

Choose the appropriate format based on request:

**Research Summary**: See [reference/research-summary-format.md](reference/research-summary-format.md)
**Comprehensive Report**: See [reference/comprehensive-report-format.md](reference/comprehensive-report-format.md)
**Quick Brief**: See [reference/quick-brief-format.md](reference/quick-brief-format.md)

## Best Practices

1. **Cast a wide net first**: Start with broad searches, then narrow down
2. **Cite sources**: Always link back to source pages using mentions
3. **Verify recency**: Check page last-edited dates for current information
4. **Cross-reference**: Validate findings across multiple sources
5. **Structure clearly**: Use headings, bullets, and formatting for readability

## Page Placement

By default, create research documents as standalone pages. If the user specifies:

- A parent page → use `page_id` parent
- A database → fetch the database first, then use appropriate `data_source_id`
- A teamspace → create in that context

## Advanced Features

**Search filtering**: See [reference/advanced-search.md](reference/advanced-search.md)
**Citation styles**: See [reference/citations.md](reference/citations.md)

## Common Issues

**"No results found"**: Try broader search terms or different teamspaces
**"Too many results"**: Add filters or search within specific pages
**"Can't access page"**: User may lack permissions, ask them to verify access
