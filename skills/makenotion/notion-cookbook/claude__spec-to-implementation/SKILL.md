# Spec to Implementation

Transforms specifications into actionable implementation plans with progress tracking. Fetches spec documents, extracts requirements, breaks down into tasks, and manages implementation workflow.

## Quick Start

When asked to implement a specification:

1. **Find spec**: Use `Notion:notion-search` to locate specification page
2. **Fetch spec**: Use `Notion:notion-fetch` to read specification content
3. **Extract requirements**: Parse and structure requirements from spec
4. **Create plan**: Use `Notion:notion-create-pages` for implementation plan
5. **Find task database**: Use `Notion:notion-search` to locate tasks database
6. **Create tasks**: Use `Notion:notion-create-pages` for individual tasks in task database
7. **Track progress**: Use `Notion:notion-update-page` to log progress and update status

## Implementation Workflow

### Step 1: Find the specification

```
1. Search for spec:
   - Use Notion:notion-search with spec name or topic
   - Apply filters if needed (e.g., created_date_range, teamspace_id)
   - Look for spec title or keyword matches
   - If not found or ambiguous, ask user for spec URL/ID

Example searches:
- "User Authentication spec"
- "Payment Integration specification"
- "Mobile App Redesign PRD"
```

### Step 2: Fetch and analyze specification

```
1. Fetch spec page:
   - Use Notion:notion-fetch with spec URL/ID from search results
   - Read full content including requirements, design, constraints

2. Parse specification:
   - Identify functional requirements
   - Note non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
   - Extract acceptance criteria
   - Identify dependencies and blockers
```

See [reference/spec-parsing.md](reference/spec-parsing.md) for parsing patterns.

### Step 3: Create implementation plan

```
1. Break down into phases/milestones
2. Identify technical approach
3. List required tasks
4. Estimate effort
5. Identify risks

Use implementation plan template (see [reference/standard-implementation-plan.md](reference/standard-implementation-plan.md) or [reference/quick-implementation-plan.md](reference/quick-implementation-plan.md))
```

### Step 4: Create implementation plan page

```
Use Notion:notion-create-pages:
- Title: "Implementation Plan: [Feature Name]"
- Content: Structured plan with phases, tasks, timeline
- Link back to original spec
- Add to appropriate location (project page, database)
```

### Step 5: Find task database

```
1. Search for task database:
   - Use Notion:notion-search to find "Tasks" or "Task Management" database
   - Look for engineering/project task tracking system
   - If not found or ambiguous, ask user for database location

2. Fetch database schema:
   - Use Notion:notion-fetch with database URL/ID
   - Get property names, types, and options
   - Identify correct data source from <data-source> tags
   - Note required properties for new tasks
```

### Step 6: Create implementation tasks

```
For each task in plan:
1. Create task in task database using Notion:notion-create-pages
2. Use parent: { data_source_id: 'collection://...' }
3. Set properties from schema:
   - Name/Title: Task description
   - Status: To Do
   - Priority: Based on criticality
   - Related Tasks: Link to spec and plan
4. Add implementation details in content
```

See [reference/task-creation.md](reference/task-creation.md) for task patterns.

### Step 7: Begin implementation

```
1. Update task status to "In Progress"
2. Add initial progress note
3. Document approach and decisions
4. Link relevant resources
```

### Step 8: Track progress

```
Regular updates:
1. Update task properties (status, progress)
2. Add progress notes with:
   - What's completed
   - Current focus
   - Blockers/issues
3. Update implementation plan with milestone completion
4. Link to related work (PRs, designs, etc.)
```

See [reference/progress-tracking.md](reference/progress-tracking.md) for tracking patterns.

## Spec Analysis Patterns

**Functional Requirements**: User stories, feature descriptions, workflows, data requirements, integration points

**Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance targets, security requirements, scalability needs, availability, compliance

**Acceptance Criteria**: Testable conditions, user validation points, performance benchmarks, completion definitions

See [reference/spec-parsing.md](reference/spec-parsing.md) for detailed parsing techniques.

## Implementation Plan Structure

**Plan includes**: Overview → Linked Spec → Requirements Summary → Technical Approach → Implementation Phases (Goal, Tasks checklist, Estimated effort) → Dependencies → Risks & Mitigation → Timeline → Success Criteria

See [reference/standard-implementation-plan.md](reference/standard-implementation-plan.md) for full plan template.

## Task Breakdown Patterns

**By Component**: Database, API endpoints, frontend components, integration, testing
**By Feature Slice**: Vertical slices (auth flow, data entry, report generation)
**By Priority**: P0 (must have), P1 (important), P2 (nice to have)

## Progress Logging

**Daily Updates** (active work): Add progress note with completed items, current focus, blockers
**Milestone Updates** (major progress): Update plan checkboxes, add milestone summary, adjust timeline
**Status Changes** (task transitions): Update properties (In Progress → In Review → Done), add completion notes, link deliverables

**Progress Format**: Date heading → Completed → In Progress → Next Steps → Blockers → Notes

See [reference/progress-tracking.md](reference/progress-tracking.md) for detailed patterns.

## Linking Spec to Implementation

**Forward Links**: Update spec page with "Implementation" section linking to plan and tasks
**Backward Links**: Reference spec in plan and tasks with "Specification" section
**Bidirectional Traceability**: Maintain both directions for easy tracking

## Implementation Status Tracking

**Plan Status**: Update with phase completion (✅ Complete, 🔄 In Progress %, ⏳ Not Started) and overall percentage
**Task Aggregation**: Query task database by plan ID to generate summary (complete, in progress, blocked, not started)

## Handling Spec Changes

**Detection**: Fetch updated spec → compare with plan → identify new requirements → assess impact
**Propagation**: Update plan → create new tasks → update affected tasks → add change note → notify via comments
**Change Log**: Track spec evolution with date, what changed, and impact

## Common Patterns

**Feature Flag**: Backend (behind flag) → Testing → Frontend (flagged) → Internal rollout → External rollout
**Database Migration**: Schema design → Migration script → Staging test → Production migration → Validation
**API Development**: API design → Backend implementation → Testing & docs → Client integration → Deployment

## Best Practices

1. **Always link spec and implementation**: Maintain bidirectional references
2. **Break down into small tasks**: Each task should be completable in 1-2 days
3. **Extract clear acceptance criteria**: Know when "done" is done
4. **Identify dependencies early**: Note blockers in plan
5. **Update progress regularly**: Daily notes for active work
6. **Track changes**: Document spec updates and their impact
7. **Use checklists**: Visual progress indicators help everyone
8. **Link deliverables**: PRs, designs, docs should link back to tasks

## Advanced Features

For additional implementation patterns and techniques, see the reference files in [reference/](reference/).

## Common Issues

**"Can't find spec"**: Use Notion:notion-search with spec name/topic, try broader terms, or ask user for URL
**"Multiple specs found"**: Ask user which spec to implement or show options
**"Can't find task database"**: Search for "Tasks" or "Task Management", or ask user for database location
**"Spec unclear"**: Note ambiguities in plan, create clarification tasks
**"Requirements conflicting"**: Document conflicts, create decision task
**"Scope too large"**: Break into smaller specs/phases
