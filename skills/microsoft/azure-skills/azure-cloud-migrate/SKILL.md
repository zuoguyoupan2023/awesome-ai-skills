# Azure Cloud Migrate

> This skill handles **assessment and code migration** of existing cloud workloads to Azure.

## Rules

1. Follow phases sequentially — do not skip
2. Generate assessment before any code migration
3. Load the scenario reference and follow its rules
4. Use `mcp_azure_mcp_get_azure_bestpractices` and `mcp_azure_mcp_documentation` MCP tools
5. Use the latest supported runtime for the target service
6. Destructive actions require `ask_user` — [functions global-rules](references/services/functions/global-rules.md) | [app-service global-rules](references/services/app-service/global-rules.md)
7. **Report progress to user** — During long-running operations (deployments, image pushes), provide resource-level status updates so the user is never left waiting without feedback — see [workflow-details.md](references/workflow-details.md)
8. **Audit service discovery in app code** — Kubernetes DNS names (e.g., `http://order-service:3001`) do not resolve in Container Apps. During assessment, scan source code for hardcoded hostnames/ports in HTTP clients and flag them for env-var-driven URL injection

## Migration Scenarios

| Source | Target | Reference |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| AWS Lambda | Azure Functions | [lambda-to-functions.md](references/services/functions/lambda-to-functions.md) ([assessment](references/services/functions/assessment.md), [code-migration](references/services/functions/code-migration.md)) |
| AWS Elastic Beanstalk | Azure App Service | [beanstalk-to-app-service.md](references/services/app-service/beanstalk-to-app-service.md) |
| Heroku | Azure App Service | [heroku-to-app-service.md](references/services/app-service/heroku-to-app-service.md) |
| Google App Engine | Azure App Service | [app-engine-to-app-service.md](references/services/app-service/app-engine-to-app-service.md) |
| AWS Fargate (ECS) | Azure Container Apps | [fargate-to-container-apps.md](references/services/container-apps/fargate-to-container-apps.md) ([assessment](references/services/container-apps/fargate-assessment-guide.md), [deployment](references/services/container-apps/fargate-deployment-guide.md)) |
| Kubernetes (GKE/EKS/Self-hosted) | Azure Container Apps | [k8s-to-container-apps.md](references/services/container-apps/k8s-to-container-apps.md) |
| GCP Cloud Run | Azure Container Apps | [cloudrun-to-container-apps.md](references/services/container-apps/cloudrun-to-container-apps.md) |
| Spring Boot (Azure Spring Apps/VMs) | Azure Container Apps | [spring-apps-to-aca.md](references/services/container-apps/spring-apps-to-aca.md) |

> No matching scenario? Use `mcp_azure_mcp_documentation` and `mcp_azure_mcp_get_azure_bestpractices` tools.

## Output Directory

All output goes to `<workspace-root-basename>-azure/` at workspace root, where `<workspace-root-basename>` is the name of the top-level workspace directory itself (NOT a subdirectory within it). Never modify the source directory.

## Steps

1. **Create** `<workspace-root-basename>-azure/` at workspace root
2. **Assess** — Analyze source, map services, generate report using the scenario-specific assessment guide → [functions assessment](references/services/functions/assessment.md) | [app-service assessment](references/services/app-service/assessment.md)
3. **Migrate** — Convert code/config using the scenario-specific migration guide → [functions code-migration](references/services/functions/code-migration.md) | [app-service code-migration](references/services/app-service/code-migration.md)
4. **Ask User** — "Migration complete. Test locally or deploy to Azure?"
5. **Hand off** to azure-prepare for infrastructure, testing, and deployment

Track progress in `migration-status.md` — see [workflow-details.md](references/workflow-details.md).
