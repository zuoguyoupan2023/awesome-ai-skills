# How to Set Up Qdrant Monitoring

Get Prometheus scraping working first, then health probes, then alerting. Do not skip monitoring setup before going to production.


## Prometheus Metrics

Use when: setting up metric collection for the first time or adding a new deployment.

- Node metrics at `/metrics` endpoint [Monitoring docs](https://skills.qdrant.tech/md/documentation/ops-monitoring/monitoring/)
- Cluster metrics at `/sys_metrics` (Qdrant Cloud only)
- Prefix customization via `service.metrics_prefix` config or `QDRANT__SERVICE__METRICS_PREFIX` env var
- Example self-hosted setup with Prometheus + Grafana [prometheus-monitoring repo](https://github.com/qdrant/prometheus-monitoring)


## Hybrid Cloud Scraping

Use when: running Qdrant Hybrid Cloud and need cluster-level visibility.

Do not just scrape Qdrant nodes. In Hybrid Cloud, you manage the Kubernetes data plane. You must also scrape the cluster-exporter and operator pods for full cluster visibility and operator state.

- Official Grafana dashboards [Grafana dashboard repo](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-cloud-grafana-dashboard)


## Liveness and Readiness Probes

Use when: configuring Kubernetes health checks.

- Use `/healthz`, `/livez`, `/readyz` for basic status, liveness, and readiness [Kubernetes health endpoints](https://skills.qdrant.tech/md/documentation/ops-monitoring/monitoring/?s=kubernetes-health-endpoints)


## Alerting

Use when: setting up alerts for production or Hybrid Cloud deployments.

- Hybrid Cloud provides ~11 pre-configured Prometheus alerts out of the box [Cloud cluster monitoring](https://skills.qdrant.tech/md/documentation/cloud/cluster-monitoring/)
- Use AlertmanagerConfig to route alerts to Slack, PagerDuty, or other targets based on labels
- At minimum, alert on: optimizer errors, node not ready, replication factor below target, disk usage >80%


## Log Centralization and Audit Logging

Use when: enterprise compliance requires centralized logs or audit trails.

- Enable JSON log format for structured analysis: set `logger.format` to `json` in config [Configuration](https://skills.qdrant.tech/md/documentation/ops-configuration/configuration/)
- Use FluentD/OpenSearch for log aggregation
- Audit logs (v1.17+) write to local filesystem (`/qdrant/storage/audit/`), not stdout. Mount a Persistent Volume and deploy a sidecar container to tail these files to stdout so DaemonSets can pick them up. [Audit logging](https://skills.qdrant.tech/md/documentation/security/?s=audit-logging)


## What NOT to Do

- Scrape `/sys_metrics` on self-hosted (only available on Qdrant Cloud)
- Scrape only Qdrant nodes in Hybrid Cloud (miss cluster-exporter and operator metrics)
- Skip monitoring setup before going to production (you will regret it)
- Alert on page cache memory usage (it's supposed to fill available RAM, normal OS behavior)
