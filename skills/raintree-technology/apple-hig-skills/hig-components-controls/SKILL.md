  Apple HIG guidance for selection and input controls including pickers, toggles,
  sliders, steppers, segmented controls, combo boxes, text fields, text views,
  labels, token fields, virtual keyboards, rating indicators, and gauges. Use
  this skill when the user says "picker or segmented control," "how should my
  form look," "what keyboard type should I use," "toggle vs checkbox," or asks
  about picker design, toggle, switch, slider, stepper, text field, text input,
  segmented control, combo box, label, token field, virtual keyboard, rating
  indicator, gauge, form design, input validation, or control state management.

# Apple HIG: Selection and Input Controls

Check for `.claude/apple-design-context.md` before asking questions. Use existing context and only ask for information not already covered.

## Key Principles

1. **Clear current state.** Users must always see what is selected. Toggles show on/off, segmented controls highlight the active segment, pickers display the current selection.

2. **Prefer standard system controls.** Built-in controls provide consistency and accessibility. Custom controls introduce a learning curve and may break assistive features.

3. **Toggles for binary states.** On or off. In Settings-style screens, changes take effect immediately. In modal forms, changes commit on confirmation.

4. **Segmented controls for mutually exclusive options.** 2-5 items, roughly equal importance, short labels.

5. **Sliders for continuous values.** When precise numeric input is not critical. Provide min/max labels or icons for range endpoints.

6. **Pickers for long option lists.** Too many options for a segmented control. Works well for dates, times, structured data.

7. **Steppers for small, precise adjustments.** Increment/decrement in fixed steps. Display current value next to the stepper with reasonable min/max bounds.

8. **Text fields for short, single-line input.** Text views for multi-line. Configure keyboard type to match expected input (email, URL, number).

9. **Combo boxes: text input + selection list.** macOS. Type a value or choose from a predefined list when custom values are valid.

10. **Token fields: discrete values as visual tokens.** macOS. For email recipients, tags, or collections of discrete items.

11. **Gauges and rating indicators display values.** Gauges show a value within a range. Rating indicators show ratings (often stars). Display-only; use interactive variants for input.

## Output Format

1. **Control recommendation with rationale** and why alternatives are less suitable.
2. **State management** -- how the control communicates current state and whether changes apply immediately or on confirmation.
3. **Validation approach** -- when to show errors and how to communicate rules.
4. **Accessibility** -- labels, traits, hints for VoiceOver.

## Questions to Ask

1. What type of data? (Boolean, choice from fixed set, numeric, free-form text?)
2. How many options?
3. Which platforms? (Combo boxes and token fields are macOS-only)
4. Settings screen or inline form?
