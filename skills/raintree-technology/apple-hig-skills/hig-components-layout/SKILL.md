  Apple Human Interface Guidelines for layout and navigation components. Use this skill when the user
  asks about "sidebar", "split view", "tab bar", "tab view", "scroll view", "window design", "panel",
  "list view", "table view", "column view", "outline view", "navigation structure", "app layout",
  "boxes", "ornaments", or organizing content hierarchically in Apple apps.
  Also use when the user says "how should I organize my app", "what navigation pattern should I use",
  "my layout breaks on iPad", "how do I build a sidebar", "should I use tabs or a sidebar",
  or "my app doesn't adapt to different screen sizes".

# Apple HIG: Layout and Navigation Components

Check for `.claude/apple-design-context.md` before asking questions. Use existing context and only ask for information not already covered.

## Key Principles

1. **Organize hierarchically.** Structure information from broad categories to specific details. Sidebars for top-level sections, lists for browsable items, detail views for individual content.

2. **Use standard navigation patterns.** Tab bars for flat navigation between peer sections (iPhone). Sidebars for deep hierarchical navigation (iPad, Mac). Match the pattern to the information architecture and platform.

3. **Adapt to screen size.** Three-column on iPad collapses to single-column on iPhone. Use size classes and adaptive APIs (NavigationSplitView) for automatic adaptation.

4. **Support multitasking on iPad.** Respond gracefully to Split View, Slide Over, and Stage Manager. Test at every split ratio and size class transition.

5. **Maintain spatial consistency on visionOS.** Windows, volumes, and ornaments in shared space. Position predictably. Use ornaments for toolbars and controls without occluding content.

6. **Use scroll views for overflow content.** Enable paging for discrete content units. Support pull-to-refresh where appropriate. Respect safe areas.

7. **Keep navigation predictable.** Users should always know where they are, how they got there, and how to go back. Use back buttons, breadcrumbs, and clear section titles.

8. **Prefer system components.** UINavigationController, UISplitViewController, NavigationSplitView, and TabView provide built-in adaptivity, accessibility, and state restoration.

## Navigation Pattern Selection

| App Structure | Recommended Pattern | Platform Adaptation |
|---|---|---|
| 3-5 peer top-level sections | Tab Bar | iPhone: bottom tab bar. iPad: sidebar (`.sidebarAdaptable`, iPadOS 18+). Mac: sidebar or toolbar tabs |
| Deep hierarchical content | Sidebar + NavigationSplitView | iPhone: single column stack. iPad: two/three columns. Mac: full multi-column |
| Deep file/folder tree | Column View | Mac: Finder-style. iPad: adaptable. iPhone: push navigation |
| Flat list with detail | Split View (two column) | iPhone: push/pop stack. iPad/Mac: primary + detail columns |
| Document-based with inspectors | Window + Panels | Mac: main window with inspector. iPad: sheet or popover |
| Spatial app with tools | Window + Ornaments | visionOS: ornaments on window. Other platforms: toolbars |

## Layout Adaptation Checklist

- [ ] **Compact width (iPhone portrait):** Navigation collapses to single stack? Tab bars visible?
- [ ] **Regular width (iPad landscape, Mac):** Navigation expands to sidebar + detail? Space used well?
- [ ] **Multitasking (iPad):** Adapts at every split ratio? Works in Slide Over?
- [ ] **Accessibility:** Supports Dynamic Type at all sizes? VoiceOver order logical?
- [ ] **Orientation:** Content reflows between portrait and landscape?
- [ ] **visionOS:** Windows positioned ergonomically? Ornaments accessible? Depth meaningful?

## Output Format

1. **Recommended navigation pattern** with rationale for the app's information architecture.
2. **Layout hierarchy** from root container down (e.g., TabView > NavigationSplitView > List > Detail).
3. **Platform adaptation** across targeted platforms and size classes.
4. **Size class behavior** at each transition.

## Questions to Ask

1. What is the app's information architecture? (Sections, hierarchy depth, top-level categories?)
2. How many top-level sections?
3. Which platforms?
4. Need multitasking on iPad?
5. SwiftUI or UIKit?
