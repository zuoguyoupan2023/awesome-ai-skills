# Apple HIG: Menus and Buttons

Check for `.claude/apple-design-context.md` before asking questions. Use existing context and only ask for information not already covered.

## Key Principles

1. **Menus should be contextual and predictable.** Standard items in standard locations. Follow platform conventions for ordering and grouping.

2. **Use standard button styles.** System-defined styles communicate affordance and maintain visual consistency. Prefer them over custom designs.

3. **Toolbars for frequent actions.** Most commonly used commands in the toolbar. Rarely used actions belong in menus.

4. **Menu bar is the primary command interface on macOS.** Every command reachable from the menu bar. Toolbars and context menus supplement, not replace.

5. **Context menus for secondary actions.** Right-click or long-press, relevant to the item under the pointer. Never put a command only in a context menu.

6. **Pop-up buttons for mutually exclusive choices.** Select exactly one option from a set.

7. **Pull-down buttons for action lists.** No current selection; they offer a set of commands.

8. **Action buttons consolidate related actions** behind a single icon in toolbars or title bars.

9. **Disclosure controls for progressive disclosure.** Show or hide additional content.

10. **Dock menus: short and focused** on the most useful actions when the app is running.
