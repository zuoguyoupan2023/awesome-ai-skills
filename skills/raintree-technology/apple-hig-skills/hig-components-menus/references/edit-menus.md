# Edit menus

  * In iOS, the edit menu displays commands in a compact, horizontal list that appears when people touch and hold or double-tap to select content in a view. People can tap a chevron on the trailing edge to expand it into a [context menu](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/context-menus).

  * In iPadOS, the edit menu looks different depending on how people reveal it. When people use touch interactions to reveal the menu, it uses the compact, horizontal appearance. In contrast, when people use a keyboard or pointing device to reveal it, the edit menu opens directly in a context menu.

  * In macOS, people can access editing commands in a context menu they can reveal while in an editing task, as well as through the app’s [Edit menu](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/the-menu-bar#Edit-menu) in the menu bar.

  * In visionOS, people use the standard [pinch and hold](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/gestures#Standard-gestures) gesture to open the edit menu as a horizontal bar, or they can open it in a context menu.

## Best practices

**Prefer the system-provided edit menu.**

**Let people reveal an edit menu using the system-defined interactions they already know.**

**Offer commands that are relevant in the current context, removing or dimming commands that don’t apply.**

**List custom commands near relevant system-provided ones.**

**When it makes sense, let people select and copy noneditable text.**

**Support undo and redo when possible.**

**In general, avoid implementing other controls that perform the same functions as edit menu items.**

**Differentiate different types of deletion commands when necessary.**

## Content

**Create short labels for custom commands.**

## Platform considerations

### iOS, iPadOS

**Ensure your edit menu works well in both styles.**

**Adjust an edit menu’s placement, if necessary.**
