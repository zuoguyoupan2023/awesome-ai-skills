  Apple HIG guidance for navigation-related components including search fields,
  page controls, and path controls. Use this skill when the user says "how should
  search work in my app," "I need a breadcrumb," "how do I paginate content," or
  asks about search field, search bar, page control, path control, breadcrumb,
  navigation component, search UX, search suggestions, search scopes, paginated
  content navigation, or file path hierarchy display. Cross-references:

# Apple HIG: Navigation Components

Check for `.claude/apple-design-context.md` before asking questions. Use existing context and only ask for information not already covered.

## Key Principles

1. **Search: discoverable with instant feedback.** Place search fields where users expect them (top of list, toolbar/navigation bar). Show results as the user types.

2. **Page controls: position in a flat page sequence.** For discrete, equally weighted pages (onboarding, photo gallery). Show current page and total count.

3. **Path controls: file hierarchy navigation.** macOS path controls display location within a directory structure and allow jumping to any ancestor.

4. **Search scopes narrow large result sets.** Provide scope buttons so users can filter without complex queries.

5. **Clear empty states for search.** Helpful message suggesting corrections or alternatives, not a blank screen.

6. **Page controls are not for hierarchical navigation.** Flat, linear sequences only. Use navigation controllers, tab bars, or sidebars for hierarchy.

7. **Keep path controls concise.** Show meaningful segments only. Users can click any segment to navigate directly.

8. **Support keyboard for search.** Command-F and system search shortcuts should activate search.

## Reference Index

| Reference | Topic | Key content |
|---|---|---|
| [search-fields.md](references/search-fields.md) | Search fields | Scopes, tokens, instant results, placement |
| [page-controls.md](references/page-controls.md) | Page controls | Dot indicators, flat page sequences |
| [path-controls.md](references/path-controls.md) | Path controls | Breadcrumbs, ancestor navigation |

## Output Format

1. **Component recommendation** -- search field, page control, or path control, and why.
2. **Behavior specification** -- interaction model (search-as-you-type, swipe for pages, click-to-navigate for paths).
3. **Platform differences** across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, visionOS.

## Questions to Ask

1. What type of content is being searched or navigated?
2. Which platforms?
3. How large is the dataset?
4. Is search the primary interaction?
