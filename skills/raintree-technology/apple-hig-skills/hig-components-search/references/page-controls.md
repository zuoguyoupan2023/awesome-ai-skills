# Page controls

## Best practices

**Use page controls to represent movement between an ordered list of pages.**

**Center a page control at the bottom of the view or window.**

## Customizing indicators

**Make sure custom indicator images are simple and clear.**

**Customize the default indicator image only when it enhances the page control’s overall meaning.**

**Avoid using more than two different indicator images in a page control.**

**Avoid coloring indicator images.**

## Platform considerations

### iOS, iPadOS

**Avoid animating page transitions during scrubbing.**

  * Automatic — Displays the background only when people interact with the control. Use this style when the page control isn’t the primary navigational element in the UI.

  * Prominent — Always displays the background. Use this style only when the control is the primary navigational control in the screen.

  * Minimal — Never displays the background. Use this style when you just want to show the position of the current page in the list and you don’t need to provide visual feedback during scrubbing.

**Avoid supporting the scrubber when you use the minimal background style.**

### tvOS

**Use page controls on collections of full-screen pages.**

### watchOS

**Use vertical pagination to separate multiple views into distinct, purposeful pages.**

**Consider limiting the content of an individual page to a single screen height.**
