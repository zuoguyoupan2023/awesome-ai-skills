# Search fields

## Best practices

**Display placeholder text that describes the type of information people can search for.**

**If possible, start search immediately when a person types.**

**Consider showing suggested search terms before search begins, or as a person types.**

**Simplify search results.**

**Consider letting people filter search results.**

## Scope controls and tokens

  * A _scope control_ acts like a [segmented control](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/segmented-controls) for choosing a category for the search.

  * A _token_ is a visual representation of a search term that someone can select and edit, and acts as a filter for any additional terms in the search.

**Use a scope control to filter among clearly defined search categories.**

**Default to a broader scope and let people refine it as they need.**

**Use tokens to filter by common search terms or items.**

**Consider pairing tokens with search suggestions.**

## Platform considerations

### iOS

  * In a tab bar at the bottom of the screen

  * In a toolbar at the bottom or top of the screen

  * Directly inline with content

#### Search in a tab bar

**Start with the search field focused to help people quickly find what they need.**

**Start with the search field unfocused to promote discovery and exploration.**

#### Search in a toolbar

  * You can include search in a bottom toolbar either as an expanded field or as a toolbar button, depending on how much space is available and how important search is to your app. When someone taps it, it animates into a search field above the keyboard so they can begin typing.

  * You can include search in a top toolbar, also called a navigation bar, where it appears as a toolbar button. When someone taps it, it animates into a search field that appears either above the keyboard or inline at the top if there isn’t space at the bottom.

**Place search at the bottom if there’s room.**

**Place search at the top when itʼs important to defer to content at the bottom of the screen, or thereʼs no bottom toolbar.**

#### Search as an inline field

**Place search as an inline field when its position alongside the content it searches strengthens that relationship.**

**Prefer placing search at the bottom.**

**When at the top, position an inline search field above the list it searches, and pin it to the top toolbar when scrolling.**

### iPadOS, macOS

**Put a search field at the trailing side of the toolbar for many common uses.**

**Include search at the top of the sidebar when filtering content or navigation there.**

**Include search as an item in the sidebar or tab bar when you want an area dedicated to discovery.**

**In a search field in a dedicated area, consider immediately focusing the field when a person navigates to the section to help people search faster and locate the field itself more easily.**

**Account for window resizing with the placement of the search field.**

### tvOS

**Provide suggestions to make searching easier.**
