  Apple HIG guidance for system experience components: widgets, live activities,
  notifications, complications, home screen quick actions, top shelf, watch faces,
  app clips, and app shortcuts. Use when asked about: "widget design", "live activity",
  "notification design", "complication", "home screen quick action",
  "top shelf", "watch face", "app clip", "app shortcut", "system experience".
  Also use when the user says "how do I design a widget," "what should my notification
  look like," "how do Live Activities work," "should I make an App Clip," or asks about
  surfaces outside the main app.
  Cross-references: hig-components-status for progress in widgets, hig-inputs for
  interaction patterns, hig-technologies for Siri and system integration.

# Apple HIG: System Experiences

Check for `.claude/apple-design-context.md` before asking questions. Use existing context and only ask for information not already covered.

## Key Principles

1. **Glanceable, immediate value.** System experiences bring your app's most important content to surfaces the user sees without launching your app. Design for seconds of attention.

2. **Respect platform context.** A Lock Screen widget has different constraints than a Home Screen widget. A complication is far smaller than a top shelf item.

3. **Widgets: show relevant information, not everything.** Display the most useful subset, updated appropriately.

4. **Support multiple widget sizes with distinct layouts.** Each size should be a thoughtful design, not a scaled version of another.

5. **Deep-link on tap.** Take users to the relevant content, not the app's root screen.

6. **Live Activities: track events with a clear start and end.** Deliveries, scores, timers, rides. Design for both Dynamic Island and Lock Screen.

7. **Stay updated and timely.** Stale data undermines trust. End promptly when the event concludes.

8. **Respect user attention with notifications.** Only send notifications for information users genuinely care about. No promotional or low-value notifications.

9. **Notifications: actionable and self-contained.** Include enough context to understand and act without opening the app. Support notification actions. Use threading and grouping.

10. **Complications: focused data on the watch face.** Design for the smallest useful representation. Support multiple families. Budget updates wisely.

11. **Home Screen quick actions: 3-4 most common tasks.** Short titles, optional subtitles, relevant SF Symbol icons.

12. **Top Shelf: tvOS showcase.** Feature content that entices: new episodes, featured items, recent content.

13. **App Clips: instant, focused functionality within a strict size budget.** Load quickly without App Store download. Only what's needed for the immediate task, then offer full app install.

14. **App Shortcuts: surface key actions to Siri and Spotlight.** Define shortcuts for frequent tasks. Use natural, conversational trigger phrases.

| [live-activities.md](references/live-activities.md) | Live Activities | Real-time tracking, Dynamic Island, Lock Screen |
| [notifications.md](references/notifications.md) | Notifications | Attention, actions, grouping, content |
| [complications.md](references/complications.md) | Complications | Watch face data, families, budgeted updates |
| [home-screen-quick-actions.md](references/home-screen-quick-actions.md) | Quick actions | Haptic Touch, common tasks, SF Symbols |
| [top-shelf.md](references/top-shelf.md) | Top shelf | Featured content, showcase |
| [app-clips.md](references/app-clips.md) | App Clips | Instant use, lightweight, focused task, NFC/QR |

## Output Format

1. **System experience recommendation** -- which surface best fits the use case.
2. **Content strategy** -- what to display, priority, what to omit.
3. **Update frequency** -- refresh rate including system budget constraints.
4. **Size/family variants** -- which to support and how layout adapts.
5. **Deep link behavior** -- where tapping takes the user.

## Questions to Ask

1. What information needs to surface outside the app?
2. Which platform?
3. How frequently does the data update?
4. What is the primary glanceable need?
