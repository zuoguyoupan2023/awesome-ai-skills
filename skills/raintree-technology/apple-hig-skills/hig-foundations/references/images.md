# Images

## Resolution

**Provide high-resolution assets for all bitmap images in your app, for every device you support.**

**In general, design images at the lowest resolution and scale them up to create high-resolution assets.**

## Best practices

**Include a color profile with each image.**

**Always test images on a range of actual devices.**

## Platform considerations

### tvOS

#### Layered images

**Use standard interface elements to display layered images.**

**Identify logical foreground, middle, and background elements.**

**Generally, keep text in the foreground.**

**Keep the background layer opaque.**

**Keep layering simple and subtle.**

**Leave a safe zone around the foreground layers of your image.**

**Always preview layered images.**

### visionOS

**Create a layered app icon.**

**Prefer vector-based art for 2D images.**

**If you need to use rasterized images, balance quality with performance as you choose a resolution.**

#### Spatial photos and spatial scenes

**Make sure spatial photos render correctly in your app.**

**Prefer the feathered glass background effect to display text over spatial photos.**

**Take visual comfort into consideration when you make spatial photos from existing 2D content.**

**Display spatial photos and spatial scenes in standalone views.**

**Use spatial scenes in your app for specific moments.**

**When displaying immersively, prefer minimal UI.**

**Prefer displaying larger spatial scenes that you center in someone’s field of view.**

### watchOS

**In general, avoid transparency to keep image files small.**

**Use autoscaling PDFs to let you provide a single asset for all screen sizes.**
