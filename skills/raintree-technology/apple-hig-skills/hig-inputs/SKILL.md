  Apple HIG guidance for input methods and interaction patterns: gestures, Apple Pencil,
  keyboards, game controllers, pointers, Digital Crown, eye tracking, focus system,
  remotes, spatial interactions, gyroscope, accelerometer, and nearby interactions.
  Use when asked about: "gesture design", "Apple Pencil", "keyboard shortcuts",
  "game controller", "pointer support", "mouse support", "trackpad", "Digital Crown",
  "eye tracking", "visionOS input", "focus system", "remote control", "gyroscope",
  "spatial interaction". Also use when the user says "what gestures should I support,"
  "how do I add keyboard shortcuts," "how does input work on Apple TV," "should I
  support Apple Pencil," or asks about input device handling.

# Apple HIG: Inputs

Check for `.claude/apple-design-context.md` before asking questions. Use existing context and only ask for information not already covered.

## Key Principles

1. **Support multiple input methods.** Touch, pointer, keyboard, pencil, voice, eyes, hands, controllers. Design for the inputs available on each platform. On iPadOS, support both touch and pointer; on macOS, both pointer and keyboard.

2. **Consistent feedback for every input action.** Visible, audible, or haptic response.

3. **Standard gestures must behave consistently.** Tap to activate, swipe to scroll/navigate, pinch to zoom, long press for context menus, drag to move. Don't override system gestures (edge swipes for back, Home, notifications).

4. **Use standard recognizers; keep custom gestures discoverable.** Apple's built-in recognizers handle edge cases and accessibility. If you add non-standard gestures, provide hints or coaching to teach them.

5. **Apple Pencil: precision drawing, markup, and selection.** Support pressure, tilt, and hover. Distinguish finger from Pencil when appropriate (finger pans, Pencil draws).

6. **Support Scribble in text fields.** Users expect to write with Pencil in any text input.

7. **Keyboard shortcuts and full navigation.** Standard shortcuts (Cmd+C/V/Z) plus custom ones visible in the iPadOS Command key overlay. Logical tab order.

8. **Respect the software keyboard.** Adjust layout when keyboard appears. Use keyboard-avoidance APIs.

9. **Game controllers: MFi controllers with on-screen fallbacks.** Map to extended gamepad profile, sensible defaults, remappable. Always offer touch or keyboard alternatives.

10. **Pointer and trackpad: native feel.** Hover effects, pointer shape adaptation, standard cursor behaviors. Two-finger scroll, pinch to zoom, swipe to navigate.

11. **Digital Crown: primary scrolling and value-adjustment input on watchOS.** Scrolling lists, adjusting values, navigating views. Haptic feedback at detents.

12. **Eyes and spatial (visionOS): look and pinch.** Generous hit targets (eye tracking is less precise than touch). Avoid sustained gaze for activation. Direct hand manipulation in immersive experiences.

13. **Focus system: critical for tvOS and visionOS.** Predictable focus movement. Every interactive element focusable. Clear visual indicators (scale, highlight, elevation). Logical focus groups.

14. **Siri Remote: limited surface.** Touch area for swiping, clickpad for selection, few physical buttons. Keep interactions simple.

15. **Gyroscope, accelerometer, UWB: use judiciously.** Suits gaming, fitness, AR. Not for essential tasks. Provide calibration and reset. For UWB, communicate distance and direction with visual or haptic cues.

## Output Format

1. **Input method recommendations by platform** and how they interact.
2. **Gesture specification table** -- standard and custom gestures with expected behaviors.
3. **Keyboard shortcut recommendations** following system conventions.
4. **Accessibility input alternatives** for VoiceOver, Switch Control, etc.

## Questions to Ask

1. Which platforms and input devices?
2. Productivity or casual app?
