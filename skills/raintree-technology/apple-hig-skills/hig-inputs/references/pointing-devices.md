# Pointing devices

## Best practices

**Be consistent when responding to mouse and trackpad gestures.**

**Avoid redefining systemwide trackpad gestures.**

**Provide a consistent experience in your app, whether people are using gestures, eyes, a pointing device, or a keyboard.**

**Let people use the pointer to reveal and hide controls that automatically minimize or fade out.**

**Provide a consistent experience when people press and hold a modifier key while interacting with objects in your app.**

## Platform considerations

### iPadOS

**Allow multiple selection in custom views when necessary.**

**Distinguish between pointer and finger input only if it provides value.**

#### Pointer accessories

**Use clear, simple images to create custom accessories.**

**Consider using the accessory transition to signal a change in an element’s state or behavior.**

#### Standard pointers and effects

**When possible, support the system-provided content effects.**

  * Use highlight for a small element that has a transparent background.

  * Use lift for a small element that has an opaque background.

  * Use hover for large elements and customize the scale, tint, and shadow attributes as needed (for guidance, see [Customizing pointers](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/pointing-devices#Customizing-pointers)).

**Prefer the system-provided pointer appearances for standard buttons and text-entry areas.**

**Add padding around interactive elements to create comfortable hit regions.**

**Create contiguous hit regions for custom bar buttons.**

**Specify the corner radius of a nonstandard element that receives the lift effect.**

#### Customizing pointers

**Prefer system-provided pointer effects for custom elements that behave like standard elements.**

**Use pointer effects in consistent ways throughout your app.**

**Avoid creating gratuitous pointer and content effects.**

**Keep custom pointer shapes simple.**

**Consider enhancing the pointer experience by displaying custom annotations that provide useful information.**

**Avoid displaying instructional text with a pointer.**

**Consider the interplay of shadow, scale, and element spacing when defining custom hover effects.**
