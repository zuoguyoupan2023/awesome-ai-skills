# File management

## Creating and opening files

**Use app menus and keyboard shortcuts to give people convenient ways to create and open documents.**

**If your app requires a custom file browser, support people’s understanding of the platform’s file system.**

## Saving work

**Help people be confident that their work is always preserved unless they cancel or delete it.**

**Hide file extensions by default, but let people view them if they choose.**

## Quick Look previews

**Use a Quick Look viewer to let people preview a file even when your app can’t open it.**

**Consider implementing a Quick Look generator if your app produces custom file types.**

## Platform considerations

### iOS, iPadOS

#### Document launcher

  * A _title card_ that displays the app title and two app-specific buttons

  * A background image that appears behind the title card and additional images — called _accessories_ — that can appear around it

  * A sheet that contains a file browser and optional app-specific controls

**Assign the title card’s buttons to your app’s most important functions.**

**Provide a background that’s clearly distinct from the accessories and title card.**

**Be mindful of accessory placement.**

**Use animation sparingly.**

#### File provider app extension

**When someone uses your file provider extension to open or import documents, display only documents that are appropriate in the current context.**

**Let people select a destination when exporting and moving documents.**

**Avoid including a custom top toolbar.**

### macOS

#### Custom file management

**Make your custom file-opening interface convenient.**

**Provide a save interface to let people change a file’s name, format, or location.**

**Consider extending the functionality of the Save dialog.**

#### Finder Sync extensions

  * Display badges in the Finder to indicate the sync status of items

  * Provide custom contextual menu items that perform file and folder management tasks, like favoriting and adding password-protection

  * Provide custom toolbar buttons that perform global actions, like initiating a sync operation

**Help people avoid losing work if they turn off autosaving.**

**When autosaving is off, make sure people know when a document has unsaved changes.**
