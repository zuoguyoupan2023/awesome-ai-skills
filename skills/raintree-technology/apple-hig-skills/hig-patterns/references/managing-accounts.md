# Managing accounts

## Best practices

**Explain the benefits of creating an account and how to sign up.**

**Delay sign-in for as long as possible.**

**If you don’t use Sign in with Apple in your iOS, iPadOS, macOS, or visionOS app, prefer using a passkey.**

**Always identify the authentication method you offer.**

**Refer only to authentication methods that are available in the current context.**

**In general, avoid offering an app-specific setting for opting in to biometric authentication.**

**Avoid using the term _passcode_ to refer to account authentication.**

## Deleting accounts

**Provide a clear way to initiate account deletion within your app or game.**

**Provide a consistent account-deletion experience whether people perform it within your app or game or on the website.**

**Consider letting people schedule account deletion to occur in the future.**

**Tell people when account deletion will complete, and notify them when it’s finished.**

**If you support in-app purchases, help people understand how billing and cancellation work when they delete their account.**

  * Billing for an auto-renewable subscription continues through Apple until people cancel the subscription, regardless of whether they delete their account.

  * After they delete their account, people need to cancel their subscription or request a refund.

## TV provider accounts

**Avoid displaying a sign-out option when people are signed in at the system level.**

**Never instruct people to sign out by adjusting privacy controls.**

## Platform considerations

### tvOS

**Prefer letting people use another device to sign up or authenticate.**

**When people are signed in to a shared account, avoid asking them to choose their profile every time they become the current user.**

**Minimize data entry.**
