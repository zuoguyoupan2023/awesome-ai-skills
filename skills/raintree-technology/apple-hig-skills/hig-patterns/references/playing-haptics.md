# Playing haptics

  * In an iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, or visionOS app or game, [game controllers](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/game-controls) can provide haptic feedback (for developer guidance, see [Playing Haptics on Game Controllers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreHaptics/playing-haptics-on-game-controllers)).

  * [Apple Pencil Pro](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/apple-pencil-and-scribble) and some trackpads can provide haptic feedback when connected to certain iPad models. (For details on Apple Pencil features and compatibility, see [Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/).)

## Best practices

**Use system-provided haptic patterns according to their documented meanings.**

**Use haptics consistently throughout your app or game.**

**Prefer using haptics to complement other feedback in your app or game.**

**Avoid overusing haptics.**

**In most apps, prefer playing short haptics that complement discrete events.**

**Make haptics optional.**

**Be aware that playing haptics might impact other user experiences.**

## Custom haptics

  * _Transient_ events are brief and compact, often feeling like taps or impulses. The experience of tapping the Flashlight button on the Home Screen is an example of a transient event.

  * _Continuous_ events feel like sustained vibrations, such as the experience of the lasers effect in a message.

## Platform considerations

### iOS

  * Use standard UI components — like [toggles](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/toggles), [sliders](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sliders), and [pickers](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/pickers) — that play Apple-designed system haptics by default.

  * When it makes sense, use a feedback generator to play one of several predefined haptic patterns in the categories of [notification](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-haptics#Notification), [impact](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-haptics#Impact), and [selection](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-haptics#Selection) (for developer guidance, see [`UIFeedbackGenerator`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIFeedbackGenerator)).
