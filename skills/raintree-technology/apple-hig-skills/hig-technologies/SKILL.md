  Apple HIG guidance for Apple technology integrations: Siri, Apple Pay, HealthKit,
  HomeKit, ARKit, machine learning, generative AI, iCloud, Sign in with Apple,
  SharePlay, CarPlay, Game Center, in-app purchase, NFC, Wallet, VoiceOver, Maps,
  Mac Catalyst, and more. Use when asked about: "Siri integration", "Apple Pay",
  "HealthKit", "HomeKit", "ARKit", "augmented reality", "machine learning",
  "generative AI", "iCloud sync", "Sign in with Apple", "SharePlay", "CarPlay",
  "in-app purchase", "NFC", "VoiceOver", "Maps", "Mac Catalyst". Also use when
  the user says "how do I integrate Siri," "what are the Apple Pay guidelines,"
  "how should my AR experience work," "how do I use Sign in with Apple," or asks
  about any Apple framework or service integration.

# Apple HIG: Technologies

Check for `.claude/apple-design-context.md` before asking questions. Use existing context and only ask for information not already covered.

## Key Principles

1. **Apple technologies extend app capabilities through system integration.** Each technology has established user-facing patterns; deviating creates confusion and erodes trust.

2. **Privacy and user control are paramount.** Especially for health, payment, and identity technologies. Request only needed data, explain why, respect choices.

3. **Siri: natural, predictable, recoverable.** Clear conversational intent phrases that complete quickly and confirm results. Support App Shortcuts for proactive suggestions. Handle errors with clear fallbacks.

4. **Payments: transparent and frictionless.** Standard Apple Pay button styles. Never ask for card details when Apple Pay is available. Clearly describe what the user is buying, the price, and whether it's one-time or subscription.

5. **Health data is deeply personal.** Explain the health benefit before requesting access. CareKit tasks should be encouraging. ResearchKit consent flows must be thorough, readable, and respect autonomy.

6. **HomeKit: simple and reliable.** Immediate response when controlling devices. Clear device state. Graceful handling of connectivity issues.

7. **AR: genuine value, not gimmicks.** Use AR when spatial context improves understanding. Guide setup (surface, lighting, space). Provide clear exit back to standard interaction.

8. **ML and generative AI: enhance without surprising.** Smart suggestions, image recognition, text prediction. Clearly attribute AI-generated content. Controls to edit, regenerate, or dismiss. Let users correct mistakes.

9. **Sign in with Apple as top option.** Standard button styles. Respect email hiding preference. ID Verifier: guided flows, don't store sensitive data beyond what verification requires.

10. **iCloud: invisible and reliable sync.** Data appears on all devices without manual intervention. Handle conflicts gracefully. Never lose data.

11. **SharePlay: real-time participation.** Support multiple participants, show presence, handle latency. AirPlay: appropriate Now Playing metadata.

12. **CarPlay: driver safety first.** Minimize interaction complexity, large touch targets, no distracting content. Only permitted app types: audio, messaging, EV charging, navigation, parking, quick food ordering.

13. **Accessibility is a baseline requirement.** Every element has a meaningful VoiceOver label, trait, and action. Support Dynamic Type, Switch Control, and other assistive technologies. Test entirely with VoiceOver enabled.
