# Apple Pay

## Offering Apple Pay

**Offer Apple Pay on all devices and browsers that support it.**

**If you use Apple Pay APIs to find out whether someone has an active card in Wallet, you must make Apple Pay the primary — but not necessarily sole — payment option everywhere you use the APIs.**

**If you also offer other payment methods, offer Apple Pay at the same time.**

**If you use an Apple Pay button to start the Apple Pay payment process, you must use the Apple-provided API to display it.**

**If you use a custom button to start the Apple Pay payment process, make sure your custom button doesn’t display “Apple Pay” or the Apple Pay logo.**

**Use Apple Pay buttons only to start the Apple Pay payment process and, when appropriate, the Apple Pay set-up process.**

**Don’t hide an Apple Pay button or make it appear unavailable.**

**Use the Apple Pay mark only to communicate that Apple Pay is accepted.**

**Inform search engines that Apple Pay is accepted on your website.**

## Streamlining checkout

**Provide a cohesive checkout experience.**

**If Apple Pay is available, assume the person wants to use it.**

**Accelerate single-item purchases with Apple Pay buttons on product detail pages.**

**Accelerate multi-item purchases with express checkout.**

**Collect necessary information, like color and size options, before people reach the Apple Pay button.**

**Collect optional information before checkout begins.**

**Handle data entry and payment errors gracefully.**

## Handling errors

**Streamline checkout by offering predefined donation amounts.**

## Using Apple Pay buttons

### Button types

  * A button that is guaranteed to use an Apple-approved caption, font, color, and style

  * Assurance that the button’s contents maintain ideal proportions as you change its size

  * Automatic translation of the button’s caption into the language that’s set for the device

  * Support for configuring the button’s corner radius to match the style of your UI

  * A system-provided alternative text label that lets VoiceOver describe the button

### Button size and position

**Prominently display the Apple Pay button.**

**Position the Apple Pay button correctly in relation to an Add to Cart button.**

**Adjust the corner radius to match the appearance of other buttons.**

**Maintain the minimum button size and margins around the button.**

### Apple Pay mark

**Use only the artwork provided by Apple, with no alterations other than height.**

**Maintain a minimum clear space around the mark of 1/10 of its height.**

## Referring to Apple Pay

**Capitalize Apple Pay in text as it appears in the Apple Trademark list.**

**Never use the Apple logo to represent the name _Apple_ in text.**

**Coordinate the font face and size with your app.**

**Don’t translate _Apple Pay_ or any other Apple trademark.**

**In a payment selection context, you can display a text-only description of Apple Pay only when all payment options have text-only descriptions.**
