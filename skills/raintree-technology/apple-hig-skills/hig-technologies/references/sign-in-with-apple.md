# Sign in with Apple

## Offering Sign in with Apple

**Ask people to sign in only in exchange for value.**

**Delay sign-in as long as possible.**

**If you require an account, ask people to set it up before offering any sign-in options.**

**Consider letting people link an existing account to Sign in with Apple.**

  * If people share an email address through Sign in with Apple and it matches the address in an existing account, you can suggest that they link Sign in with Apple to that account.

  * If people used an existing user name and password to sign in, you can display an account-linking suggestion in their account’s settings view or another logical place.

**In a commerce app, wait until after people make a purchase before asking them to create an account.**

**As soon as Sign in with Apple completes, welcome people to their new account.**

**Indicate when people are currently signed in.**

## Collecting data

**Clarify whether the additional data you request is required or just recommended.**

**Don’t ask people to supply a password.**

**Avoid asking for a personal email address when people supply a private relay address.**

  * Make sure that people can view their private relay address in your app or website

  * Direct people to Settings > Apple Account > Password & Security > Apps using Apple Account to retrieve their private relay address

  * Use other identifying values, like an order number or phone number collected as part of a purchase

**Give people a chance to engage with your app before asking for optional data.**

**Be transparent about the data you collect.**

## Displaying buttons

**Prominently display a Sign in with Apple button.**

### Using the system-provided buttons

  * A button that’s guaranteed to use an Apple-approved appearance

  * Assurance that the button’s contents maintain ideal proportions as you change its style

  * Automatic translation of the button’s title into the language specified by the device

  * Support for configuring the button’s corner radius to match the style of your UI (iOS, macOS, and web)

  * A system-provided alternative text label that lets VoiceOver describe the button

#### Button size and corner radius

**Adjust the corner radius to match the appearance of other buttons in your app.**

**Maintain the minimum button size and margin around the button in iOS, macOS, and the web.**

### Creating a custom Sign in with Apple button

  * Use the logo file to position the Apple logo in a button; never use the Apple logo as a button.

  * Match the height of the logo file to the height of the button.

  * Don’t crop the logo file.

  * Don’t add vertical padding.

  * Titles. Use only _Sign in with Apple_ , _Sign up with Apple_ , or _Continue with Apple_.

  * General shape. Buttons that combine the logo with text are always rectangular; logo-only buttons can be circular or rectangular.

  * Logo and title colors. Within a button, both items must be either black or white; don’t use custom colors.

  * Title font. You can also adjust the font’s weight and size.

  * Title case. You can capitalize every letter in the title.

  * Background appearance. The overall color needs to remain black or white. If necessary, you can include a subtle texture or gradient to help the button harmonize with your interface.

  * Button corner radius. You can use a corner radius value that matches the other buttons in your UI.

  * Button bezel and shadow. For example, you can use a stroke to emphasize the button bezel or add a drop shadow.

#### Custom buttons with a logo and text

**Choose the format of the logo file based on the height of your button.**

**Prefer the system font for the title — that is, Sign in with Apple, Sign up with Apple, or Continue with Apple.**

**In general, preserve the capitalization style of the title.**

**Keep the title and logo vertically aligned within the button.**

**Inset the logo if necessary.**

**Maintain a minimum margin between the title and the right edge of the button.**

**Maintain the minimum button size and margin around the button.**

#### Custom logo-only buttons

**Choose the format of the logo file based on the size of your button.**

**Don’t add horizontal padding to a logo-only image.**

**Use a mask to change the default square shape of the logo-only image.**

**Maintain a minimum margin around the button.**
