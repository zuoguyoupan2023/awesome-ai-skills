# After-Action Report

Run a structured retrospective on a launch, incident, or completed project. Produce actionable lessons, not just a document.

This skill is for after-the-fact analysis. For active incident response, use `incident-response`. For planning launches, use `launch-runbook`.

---

## When to use

- After any incident (any severity)
- After every major launch
- At the end of a project (sprint retro, quarterly retro, project closeout)
- When a recurring issue has happened enough times to demand investigation
- When a decision didn't work out and the team wants to learn

## When NOT to use

- During an active incident (use `incident-response`)
- For pre-launch planning (use `launch-runbook`)
- For one-off bug fixes that don't merit broad analysis

---

## Required inputs

- The event being analyzed (incident, launch, project)
- A timeline reconstructed from logs, chat, tickets
- Participant accounts of what they observed and did
- Outcomes and impact (what actually happened to users, the business)

---

## The framework: blameless analysis

The most important principle: blameless. Without it, retrospectives produce hidden information and theatrical lessons rather than real ones.

### What blameless means

- Focus on systems, not individuals
- Assume everyone made reasonable decisions given what they knew at the time
- The question is "why was this decision reasonable to make?" not "who screwed up?"
- Fixing the system means the next person in that situation succeeds where this person didn't

### What blameless does not mean

- No accountability (action items still have owners)
- No hard truths (sometimes the system is broken in obvious ways)
- No standards (some patterns of failure are individual, not systemic)
- No discomfort (real reflection is uncomfortable)

---

## The framework: 6 sections

A complete AAR covers six sections.

### 1. Summary

A 2 to 3 paragraph overview. Captures:

- What happened
- Impact (users, business, time)
- Root cause (in plain language)
- Top action items

This is what executives read. Anyone who reads only this section should leave with the most important information.

### 2. Timeline

A reconstructed timeline of events.

For incidents:
- T-0: Detection
- T+X: Acknowledgment
- T+Y: Severity assessed, IC assigned
- T+Z: Investigation began
- ... mitigation, communication, resolution events
- T+N: Resolution declared

For launches:
- Pre-launch decisions and milestones
- Launch day events
- Post-launch monitoring observations

For projects:
- Major milestones, decisions, pivots
- Both planned and emergent

The timeline is the source of truth. Disagreements about what happened get resolved here.

### 3. Root cause analysis

What caused this, in plain language.

Use one or both of:

**Five whys.** Start with the surface symptom. Ask "why?" Repeat 5 times (or until you reach a true root). Each "why" should yield a substantive answer, not a tautology.

Example:
- Why did the site go down? Database connection pool exhausted.
- Why was the pool exhausted? Background job opened too many connections.
- Why did the background job open too many connections? Connection cleanup code didn't run on errors.
- Why didn't cleanup run on errors? Original code review didn't cover error paths.
- Why didn't the review cover error paths? No checklist for error handling in our review process.

The fifth why often reveals the system fix. In this case: improve the review process.

**Causal chain.** Multiple contributing factors that combined.

- Factor 1: Background job opened too many connections (technical)
- Factor 2: Connection limit was set too low for actual traffic (configuration)
- Factor 3: No alert on connection pool saturation (monitoring)
- Factor 4: Recent traffic doubled without infra capacity review (process)

No single fix addresses the incident. Multiple gaps need attention.

### 4. Contributing factors

Factors that didn't cause the event but made it worse, or removed safety nets that would have caught it.

- Monitoring gaps
- Documentation gaps
- Process gaps
- Tooling gaps
- Knowledge gaps

A "would have been caught earlier if..." factor.

### 5. What went well

Real lessons require capturing successes, not just failures.

- What detection worked?
- What response worked?
- What decisions were good?
- What tools or processes performed as expected?

This is not consolation. It's calibration. Things that worked here should be reinforced and replicated.

### 6. Action items

Specific, owned, dated.

| Action | Owner | Due | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| Add alert on connection pool saturation | [name] | [date] | Monitoring |
| Add error handling checklist to PR template | [name] | [date] | Process |
| Audit other background jobs for similar issue | [name] | [date] | Code |

**Action item criteria:**

- **Specific.** "Improve monitoring" is not actionable. "Add alert on connection pool saturation, threshold 80%, page on-call" is.
- **Owned.** A name. Not "the team."
- **Dated.** A real date. Not "soon."
- **Sized.** Roughly hours, days, or weeks of effort.
- **Closeable.** Definition of done is clear.

Action items that don't close in their committed timeframe should re-surface in the next AAR. Patterns of unclosed actions point to deeper organizational issues.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Schedule the AAR

Within 1 to 2 weeks of the event. Long enough that emotions cooled and facts gathered. Short enough that memories are fresh.

For incidents: pre-decided in the response procedure.
For launches: schedule on the runbook.
For projects: schedule at project closeout.

### 2. Gather inputs

Before the meeting:

- Reconstructed timeline (often the scribe's notes if there was one)
- Logs, chat transcripts, tickets, incident updates
- Individual accounts from each participant (written, before the meeting)
- Impact data (users affected, duration, revenue impact, etc.)

### 3. Run the meeting

Typical agenda (60 to 90 minutes):

- Read the summary as drafted (5 min)
- Walk the timeline together. Add corrections. Resolve disagreements. (20 to 30 min)
- Discuss root cause. Use five whys or causal chain. (15 to 20 min)
- Discuss contributing factors. (10 min)
- Discuss what went well. (10 min)
- Identify action items. Owners and dates. (10 min)

A facilitator runs the meeting. Often the IC for an incident, or a project lead for a project. The facilitator is not the scribe.

### 4. Write the document

Within a few days of the meeting. The full AAR includes all 6 sections.

### 5. Distribute

Internal: post in a known location. Make searchable. Reference in onboarding.

For high-severity incidents: external summary may be appropriate (status page, customer email, public blog).

### 6. Track action items

Every action item should be tracked to closure. The next AAR re-surfaces unclosed ones.

## Failure patterns

- **Skipping the AAR for "small" incidents.** Patterns get missed.
- **Naming and shaming.** Real lessons get hidden when people fear blame.
- **Generic action items.** "Improve testing" instead of specific testing change.
- **Action items that never close.** Filed, forgotten. Same incident recurs.
- **Theater retrospectives.** Going through the motions without genuine reflection.
- **Skipping "what went well."** Misses calibration on what's working.
- **Blame externalized.** "Our vendor failed." OK, what's our system for vendor risk?
- **Single-person AAR.** One person writes the whole thing. Misses other perspectives.
- **AAR only for failures.** Successful launches deserve AARs too. Lessons from success are valuable.
- **Long delays.** Memories fade. Conversations cool. Get it done within 2 weeks.
