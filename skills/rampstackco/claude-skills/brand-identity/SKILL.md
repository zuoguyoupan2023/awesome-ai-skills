# Brand Identity

Design or evaluate the visual artifacts that express a brand: logo system, color, typography, imagery, iconography, and motion. Stack-agnostic. Tool-agnostic.

This skill assumes a brand direction is already approved (positioning, mood, name). If not, run `brand-ideation` first.

---

## When to use

- Designing a logo system
- Defining a brand color palette
- Choosing brand typography
- Developing iconography or illustration style
- Defining imagery direction (photography, illustration)
- Establishing motion principles
- Auditing an existing identity for cohesion or gaps

## When NOT to use

- Brand direction is not yet defined (use `brand-ideation`)
- Documenting a finished system (use `brand-style-guide`)
- Defining voice and tone (use `brand-voice`)
- Building UI components from an existing brand (use `design-standards` or `design-system`)

---

## Required inputs

- The brand name and approved positioning
- The mood direction (from ideation, or supplied as references)
- Audience and category context
- Application contexts (web, print, packaging, motion - whatever applies)
- Constraints (parent brand requirements, regulatory marks, accessibility minimums)

## The framework: 5 elements

A complete identity has five elements. Each element should reinforce the others. Inconsistency between them is the most common identity failure.

### 1. Logo system

Most brands need not one logo but a system of marks for different contexts.

**Components of a logo system:**

- **Primary mark.** The main logo. Used wherever there is room.
- **Wordmark.** Just the typography, no symbol. Used in tight horizontal contexts.
- **Symbol or glyph.** Just the symbol, no type. Used in app icons, favicons, social avatars.
- **Lockup variations.** Horizontal, stacked, square - whichever apply.
- **Monogram.** The initial(s) styled as a mark. Optional but useful for small contexts.

**Design principles:**

- **Legible at 16 pixels.** Test the logo at favicon size. If it falls apart, redesign.
- **Reproducible in single-color.** If the logo only works in full color, it cannot be screen-printed, embroidered, or rendered in browser favicons.
- **Distinctive silhouette.** Squint at it. Can you still tell what it is? If it looks like every other logo in the category at silhouette, redesign.
- **Construction grid.** Every curve and angle is intentional. Document the construction.

**Common failure:**
- Designing only the primary mark and discovering at launch that the wordmark, glyph, and small-size variants do not exist.

### 2. Color system

A color system is more than a palette. It is the rules for how color carries meaning.

**Components:**

- **Primary color.** The signature color most associated with the brand.
- **Secondary colors.** 1 to 3 supporting colors that extend the palette.
- **Neutrals.** The grays and tints that make up most of the surface area.
- **Semantic colors.** Success, warning, error, info - if the brand operates in product UI.
- **Accent colors.** Used sparingly for highlight and emphasis.

**Per color, document:**
- Hex, RGB, HSL, CMYK (if print is in scope), and Pantone (if brand-critical print exists)
- WCAG AA contrast against the other colors in the system
- Allowed and disallowed pairings (some brand colors look terrible together)
- Usage notes (when to use, when not to use)

**Design principles:**

- **Test for accessibility.** WCAG AA requires 4.5:1 contrast for normal text, 3:1 for large text. If the brand color cannot pass either against white, you have a problem.
- **Test for color blindness.** Around 8 percent of men have some form of color blindness. Critical UI signals should not rely on color alone.
- **Define neutrals carefully.** Neutrals are 80 percent of the surface area in most brand applications. They carry more weight than the brand color.
- **Limit the palette.** A 30-color palette is unmanageable. 5 to 8 carefully chosen colors beats a sprawling system.

### 3. Typography

Type is the second-most-recognizable element of a brand after the logo.

**Components of a type system:**

- **Display typeface.** For headlines and brand moments.
- **Body typeface.** For long-form reading. Often the same as display, sometimes different.
- **Monospace typeface** (if applicable for technical brands).
- **Type scale.** The set of sizes used across applications. Typically 5 to 8 steps.
- **Type weights and styles.** Which weights and italics are part of the system.

**Design principles:**

- **Pairing.** If using two typefaces, they must work together at body and display sizes. Common pattern: serif display + sans body, or geometric sans display + humanist sans body.
- **Web licensing.** Confirm web licensing covers expected pageviews. Some popular typefaces have prohibitive web licenses.
- **Variable fonts** are increasingly the right call for performance and flexibility.
- **Fallback stack.** Specify system fallbacks for when the brand font fails to load. The fallback should be visually similar.
- **Open-source alternatives.** Document open-source equivalents for situations where licensing is impractical (third-party tools, embedded contexts).

### 4. Imagery and illustration

Imagery direction is often underspecified, leading to brand drift over time.

**Photography direction:**

- **Subject matter.** What does the brand show?
- **Composition style.** Tight crops, wide environments, candid, posed?
- **Lighting.** Bright and natural, dramatic and directional, soft and diffused?
- **Color treatment.** True color, warm shifted, desaturated, high-contrast?
- **What to reject.** Stock photo aesthetics, specific cliches in the category.

**Illustration direction:**

- **Style.** Flat, dimensional, hand-drawn, geometric, abstract, representational?
- **Color use.** Full palette, restricted palette, brand colors only?
- **Line treatment.** Bold and outlined, soft and shaded, no outlines?
- **Subject matter.** What gets illustrated and what does not?

**Iconography:**

- **Style.** Filled or outline. Rounded or sharp. Single weight or variable.
- **Grid.** Pixel-perfect grid (often 24x24 or 16x16 base).
- **Stroke weight.** Consistent across the icon set.
- **Set.** Which icons exist, and how new icons get added consistently.

### 5. Motion

If the brand lives in any digital product, marketing video, or animated touchpoint, motion is part of the identity.

**Motion principles to define:**

- **Easing curves.** Default easings used across animations. Linear, ease-in-out, custom.
- **Duration scale.** Fast (100ms), medium (200-300ms), slow (500ms+) and when each applies.
- **Choreography.** How elements enter, exit, and respond to interaction.
- **Brand moments.** Signature animations (logo build, page transitions, loaders).

**Design principles:**

- **Restraint.** Most motion in product UI should be quick and subtle. Reserve dramatic motion for brand moments.
- **Reduced motion.** Always provide a `prefers-reduced-motion` alternative for users with vestibular sensitivities.
- **Performance.** Animations must be 60fps on the target devices. Profile before shipping.

## Workflow

1. **Confirm brand direction.** Positioning, mood, audience. If unclear, return to `brand-ideation`.
2. **Audit applications.** List every place the brand will appear (web, print, packaging, app, social, signage, video). The application contexts drive what the system needs to handle.
3. **Element-by-element design.** Start with logo and color, since these constrain typography. Then type. Then imagery, iconography, motion.
4. **Stress-test.** Apply the system to 3 to 5 mock applications (homepage, social post, business card, product UI, signage). Where does it break? Iterate.
5. **Document.** Each element with rules, examples, and dos/don'ts. This becomes the input to `brand-style-guide`.
6. **Get sign-off** before broad rollout. Identity changes after rollout are 10x the cost of changes during design.

## Failure patterns

- **Designing logos in isolation from application.** A logo that looks great on a hi-res mockup but illegible at favicon size is a design failure.
- **Picking a brand color without contrast testing.** A brand color that fails WCAG AA against white means UI built on the brand will be inaccessible by default.
- **Specifying typography without checking web licensing.** Discovering at deploy that the foundry charges per-pageview for the chosen typeface is a budget-buster.
- **Skipping imagery direction.** Without it, the brand becomes whatever stock photos the next person picks.
- **Treating motion as decoration.** Inconsistent motion erodes brand cohesion as fast as inconsistent color.
- **Designing only primary states.** What does the brand look like in error? In dark mode? In a localization where the wordmark needs to flip direction? These are not edge cases; they are the brand.

## Output format

Default output is a structured set of files:

- `identity/logo/` - All logo variants (SVG primary, plus PNG/JPG exports at common sizes)
- `identity/colors.md` - Color system with hex codes, contrast ratios, usage rules
- `identity/typography.md` - Type system with scale, weights, fallbacks
- `identity/imagery.md` - Imagery direction with reference examples
- `identity/iconography/` - Icon set or icon style spec
- `identity/motion.md` - Motion principles
- `identity/applications/` - 3 to 5 application mockups stress-testing the system

These feed directly into `brand-style-guide`.
