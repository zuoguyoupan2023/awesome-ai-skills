# Content Migration

Move content from one platform, domain, or URL structure to another without breaking SEO, user bookmarks, or downstream integrations. Stack-agnostic.

---

## When to use

- Migrating from one CMS to another (e.g., WordPress to a headless setup)
- Consolidating multiple sites into one
- Splitting one site into multiple
- Changing URL structures
- Domain migration (one brand to another, mergers, rebrands)
- Migrating from a custom build to a platform (or vice versa)
- Content audit-driven cleanup as part of a larger move

## When NOT to use

- A net-new site with no existing content (no migration needed)
- Single-page edits or content updates within an existing site (use `content-and-copy`)
- Performance or technical SEO improvements without URL changes (use `seo-technical`)
- Routine content audits (use `seo-content-audit`)

---

## Required inputs

- The source: current platform, current URL structure, current content inventory
- The destination: target platform, target URL structure, target capabilities
- The reason for migration (drives priority of what to preserve)
- Constraints (timeline, budget, downtime tolerance)
- Stakeholders (SEO, content, dev, comms, support)

---

## The framework: 6 phases

Every content migration follows the same arc. Skipping a phase is how migrations go badly.

### Phase 1: Inventory

You can't migrate what you don't know. Build a complete map of what exists.

For each piece of content:
- URL
- Title
- Content type (article, landing page, product, doc, etc.)
- Status (live, draft, archived, scheduled)
- Last modified
- Author or owner
- Traffic (last 12 months)
- Backlinks (top external referrers)
- Internal links pointing to it
- Embedded assets (images, video, downloads)

Pull from: CMS export, XML sitemap, server logs, analytics, search console, backlink tool.

The inventory is a spreadsheet. It's the source of truth for the rest of the migration.

### Phase 2: Audit and decide

For each piece of content, decide:

- **Keep:** migrate as-is
- **Update:** migrate with edits (refresh, expand, fix)
- **Merge:** combine with another piece, redirect both old URLs to the new
- **Redirect:** don't migrate; redirect to a related page
- **Delete:** don't migrate, no redirect (use sparingly; only for clearly low-value pages)

This is `seo-content-audit` work. The migration is the time to do it; not the time to skip it.

For each "Update" or "Merge," document the specific changes.

### Phase 3: Map URLs

The URL map is the most important migration artifact.

| Old URL | New URL | Status code | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| /old/path | /new/path | 301 | Direct equivalent |
| /old/page-1, /old/page-2 | /new/merged | 301 | Merged content |
| /old/deprecated | /related/replacement | 301 | Closest replacement |
| /old/junk | (none) | 410 | Intentionally gone |

Rules:
- 301 (permanent redirect) for content that has a new home
- 410 (gone) for intentionally deleted content
- Avoid 404 (not found) where 410 is more accurate
- Never redirect everything to the homepage; specific is always better
- Map every URL with traffic or backlinks; lower-priority URLs can be patterned

For domain migrations, use a 1:1 path mapping by default (`old.com/page` → `new.com/page`) with specific overrides where structure changes.

### Phase 4: Build and stage

Build the destination. Don't skip a staging environment.

- Set up the new platform with the new content
- Implement the URL map (most platforms support a redirect file or rule)
- Verify a representative sample of redirects work
- Test critical user flows (signup, purchase, contact)
- Validate analytics, monitoring, and integrations
- Test from search engine perspective: robots.txt, sitemap, canonicals

If possible, get the destination crawled by Google before the cutover, so it's already indexed when redirects flip.

### Phase 5: Cut over

The actual switch. Plan it like a launch (and use `launch-runbook` alongside this skill).

Pre-cutover:
- Comms to stakeholders (date, expected impact)
- Comms to users if downtime expected
- Support team prepped for likely questions
- Lower DNS TTL the day before (1-3 days for safety)
- Backup of source platform (in case rollback is needed)

Cutover:
- Redirect rules go live
- DNS changes go live
- New sitemap submitted to search engines
- Old sitemap removed or updated
- Internal links audited and updated to point to new URLs (where possible)
- Status page or banner if user-visible disruption

Immediately post-cutover:
- Smoke test top 50 pages from the inventory
- Verify redirects are 301 (not 302)
- Verify search console for errors
- Watch real-time traffic for unexpected drops
- Watch error logs for missing assets, broken integrations

### Phase 6: Monitor and recover

The migration isn't done at cutover. The next 30-90 days reveal problems.

Watch:
- **Traffic:** expect a temporary drop (10-30% is common); should recover in 4-8 weeks. A persistent drop beyond that is a problem.
- **Indexing:** new URLs should be crawled and indexed. Check coverage in search console.
- **Rankings:** track top keywords. A position drop is normal; a position cliff is a sign of a redirect or canonical problem.
- **Backlinks:** check that linked-from-elsewhere pages still resolve to the right destination.
- **404s:** any URL getting 404s that should have been redirected? Add to the map.
- **User reports:** support tickets, social media. Are users finding their old links?

Common 30-day fixes:
- Add missed redirects from 404 patterns
- Update internal links you missed
- Re-submit sitemap if indexing stalls
- Investigate and fix any crawl errors

## Workflow

### Step 1: Set the scope

What's in scope? What's out? Write it down. Migrations expand if not bounded.

### Step 2: Build the inventory

Pull every URL, traffic, backlinks, internal links. The spreadsheet is the artifact.

### Step 3: Decide per piece

Keep, update, merge, redirect, delete. Document decisions.

### Step 4: Map URLs

The complete redirect map. Reviewed by SEO and content stakeholders.

### Step 5: Build the destination

In a staging environment. Real content (or representative content). Real redirects.

### Step 6: Test

- Sample of redirects (top 20 by traffic, top 20 by backlinks, edge cases)
- Critical flows (signup, checkout, contact)
- Analytics and monitoring
- Search-engine perspective (robots.txt, sitemap, canonicals)

### Step 7: Cut over

Following the cutover checklist. Have rollback ready.

### Step 8: Monitor

Daily for the first week. Weekly for the first month. Monthly through 90 days.

### Step 9: Document the result

What worked. What didn't. Lessons. (See `after-action-report`.)

## Failure patterns

**No URL inventory.** Migration team thinks they have everything. They don't. Old PDFs, archived posts, marketing landing pages with backlinks. Build the inventory.

**302 redirects instead of 301.** 302 is temporary. SEO equity doesn't reliably pass. Use 301 unless you have a specific reason.

**Redirecting everything to the homepage.** "We'll let users find their way." They won't. They'll bounce. Map specifically.

**Long redirect chains.** /a → /b → /c → /d. Each hop loses a little equity and adds latency. Collapse to /a → /d.

**Forgetting non-HTML URLs.** PDFs, images, downloads. They have URLs too. They have backlinks too. Include in the map.

**Forgetting query strings.** `/page?id=123` is a different URL than `/page`. Patterns or specific maps for query string variants.

**Ignoring trailing slashes.** `/page` and `/page/` are different to most servers. Pick one canonical form. Redirect the other.

**No staging.** The first time the migration runs is in production. Things break. Stage and test.

**Stage that's too different from production.** Different DNS, different CDN, different platform. Tests pass on staging, fail on production. Stage as close to prod as feasible.

**Leaving the source live.** Two sites serving the same content. Duplicate content, split equity, user confusion. Take down the source after confirming the destination is solid.

**Leaving the source domain unrenewed.** Domain expires, redirects break, traffic dies. Renew the source domain for a long time, even if you're not using it.

**Big-bang migration with no rollback plan.** Something goes wrong. Now what? Plan rollback before cutover.

**Cutover during a busy period.** End of quarter, holiday season, big campaign. Bad timing. Pick a quiet period.

**No comms.** Users find their bookmarks broken with no warning. Some won't come back. Communicate.

**Migration as a one-time event.** It's not done at cutover. Monitor for 30-90 days. Fix what surfaces.

**Treating migration as just a dev project.** SEO, content, support, comms all need to be involved. Cross-functional from day one.
