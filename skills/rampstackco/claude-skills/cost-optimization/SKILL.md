# Cost Optimization

Audit cloud, SaaS, and infrastructure spend. Cut what's not earning its keep. Rightsize what's oversized. Negotiate what's negotiable. Without breaking what works.

---

## When to use

- Quarterly or annual cost review
- Finance flags rising spend
- Vendor contract renewal coming up
- Budget cut required
- New leadership wants the numbers
- Migrating between providers (cost is part of the case)
- Audit before scaling significantly (catch waste before it scales)

## When NOT to use

- Active incident response (use `incident-response`)
- Performance issues that happen to involve infrastructure (use `performance-optimization`)
- Vendor evaluation for a new purchase (use `vendor-evaluation`)
- Personnel or org costs (out of scope for this skill)

---

## Required inputs

- Current cost (monthly, ideally for the last 12 months)
- Cost broken down by service or vendor
- Inventory of cloud resources (instances, databases, storage, etc.)
- Inventory of SaaS subscriptions
- Owners per cost line (who decided to spend this, who uses it)
- Constraints (compliance, performance, contract terms)

---

## The framework: 5 levers

Every cost optimization opportunity falls into one of these levers.

### Lever 1: Eliminate

Stop paying for things that aren't used.

- Idle resources (instances, databases, environments running but unused)
- Subscriptions where no one logs in
- Duplicate tools (multiple tools doing the same job)
- Old projects still incurring cost
- Test environments that should have been torn down
- Forgotten domains, backups, snapshots, logs

This is usually the largest opportunity in the first audit. Often 10-30% of spend.

### Lever 2: Rightsize

Pay for what you actually use, not what you provisioned for the worst case three years ago.

- Oversized instances (CPU and memory utilization low)
- Over-provisioned databases (storage and throughput far above usage)
- Over-purchased SaaS seats
- Premium plans where standard would suffice
- High-availability setups for non-critical systems

Rightsizing requires real usage data, not theoretical needs.

### Lever 3: Restructure

Use cheaper structures for the same workload.

- Reserved or committed-use pricing (1-3 year commitments at 30-70% discount)
- Spot or preemptible instances for fault-tolerant work
- Cold storage for data accessed rarely
- Tiered storage (hot/warm/cold) by access pattern
- CDN caching to reduce origin load
- Compression and deduplication
- Serverless for spiky workloads
- Reserved instances for steady workloads

The right structure depends on the access pattern. Mismatch costs money.

### Lever 4: Negotiate

Pay less for the same thing.

- Annual contracts at lower rates than monthly
- Volume discounts at higher tiers
- Multi-year commitments for predictable workloads
- Bundle deals (consolidating services with one vendor)
- Renewal negotiation (vendors expect you to ask)
- RFP / competitive bid (using alternatives as leverage)

Most enterprise vendors negotiate. Most SaaS vendors don't, except at higher tiers. Consumer-tier services usually don't.

### Lever 5: Reframe

Change the question.

- Build vs buy: maybe in-house is cheaper at scale
- Buy vs build: maybe outsourcing is cheaper at small scale
- Different architecture (e.g., monolith vs microservices) has different cost profiles
- Different audience (do all customers need the same tier?)
- Different stack (open source vs commercial)

Reframe is the longest-lead lever. Worth thinking about even if not actionable now.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Pull the spend data

Get monthly costs by service, vendor, and (where possible) team or project.

For cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure): the billing console and cost-explorer tools.
For SaaS: each vendor's billing portal, plus an SaaS-management tool if available.
For everything else: bank statements and accounting export.

12 months minimum. Trends matter as much as absolute numbers.

### Step 2: Categorize

Organize spend into categories:

- **Hosting / compute**
- **Storage**
- **Database**
- **Networking / CDN**
- **Monitoring / observability**
- **Email**
- **CMS / hosting platforms**
- **Analytics / marketing**
- **Productivity / collaboration**
- **Development tools**
- **Security / compliance**
- **Other**

The categories vary by business. The point is: similar costs grouped, easy to compare.

### Step 3: Identify the biggest line items

80/20 rule. Usually 20% of vendors account for 80% of spend.

Focus the audit on the top 80%. The long tail can be cleaned up but rarely yields big savings per item.

### Step 4: Apply the 5 levers

For each major line item, walk the levers:

| Lever | Question |
|---|---|
| Eliminate | Is it used? Could we stop using it? |
| Rightsize | Are we paying for capacity we don't use? |
| Restructure | Is there a cheaper pricing model or service tier? |
| Negotiate | When was the last renewal? Did we negotiate? |
| Reframe | Is this even the right approach? |

Document the opportunity, the effort, the risk, and the savings estimate.

### Step 5: Prioritize

Plot opportunities on a 2x2:
- Y axis: savings
- X axis: effort

Quadrants:
- High savings, low effort: do first
- High savings, high effort: plan
- Low savings, low effort: do as time allows
- Low savings, high effort: skip

Also consider risk:
- Eliminate something used by no one: low risk
- Rightsize a database: medium risk (test in staging first)
- Replace a critical dependency: high risk (plan carefully)

### Step 6: Execute the easy wins

For each easy-win opportunity:
- Document the change
- Get owner approval
- Make the change
- Monitor for unexpected impact
- Confirm cost reduction in next billing cycle

Easy wins typically include:
- Canceling unused subscriptions
- Tearing down idle resources
- Switching off dev environments outside business hours
- Moving cold data to cheaper storage tiers

### Step 7: Plan the larger work

For higher-effort opportunities:
- Spec the change (use `pm-spec-writing` for the plan)
- Test in staging
- Roll out incrementally
- Validate cost impact

Examples:
- Migrating to reserved instances
- Consolidating monitoring vendors
- Migrating from one CMS to another with cost benefit

### Step 8: Set up ongoing visibility

Optimization isn't one-time. Costs creep back up.

- Monthly cost review (at least)
- Cost dashboard (current, trend, by category)
- Alerts on cost spikes (e.g., daily spend exceeds threshold)
- Tagging or labeling on cloud resources (cost by team or project)
- Quarterly deeper review

### Step 9: Negotiate at renewal

For vendor contracts up for renewal:
- Start the conversation 60-90 days before renewal
- Have alternatives identified (even if you don't switch)
- Ask for a multi-year discount
- Ask about volume tiers
- Ask if usage rightsizing is possible
- Be willing to walk (most vendors find a way to keep you)

Pre-pandemic, many vendors auto-renewed at increases. Post-pandemic, many are hungry for retention. Ask.

### Step 10: Document the policy

Going forward:
- New vendor evaluation requires cost justification
- Resource provisioning has approval thresholds
- Tagging and labeling are required for cloud resources
- Quarterly review is calendared
- Cost attribution is clear

Without policy, costs creep.

## Common opportunities by category

### Hosting and compute

- Reserved or committed-use pricing for predictable workloads (30-70% off)
- Spot or preemptible for fault-tolerant batch
- Auto-scaling for variable loads
- Right instance family (compute-optimized, memory-optimized, etc.)
- Dev/staging instances stopped outside business hours

### Storage

- Lifecycle policies to move old data to cheaper tiers
- Delete old logs, backups, snapshots
- Compression for archival
- Object versioning costs (every version is a stored object)

### Database

- Right size based on actual CPU/memory usage
- Reserved capacity for predictable workloads
- Read replicas for read-heavy workloads (cheaper than scaling primary)
- Drop unused indexes (indexes cost storage and write performance)
- Old data archived or deleted

### Networking and CDN

- CDN reduces origin egress costs (often the biggest cost category)
- Compression on the wire
- Image and video optimization
- Region-aware routing

### Monitoring and observability

- Sample logs (don't ingest 100% of high-volume sources)
- Retention policies (do you need 90 days or 30?)
- Consolidate tools where possible
- Free or open-source tooling for non-critical needs

### SaaS

- Audit logins per seat (inactive users on $X/seat = $X waste)
- Renegotiate at renewal
- Move to annual billing for the discount
- Consolidate overlapping tools

## Failure patterns

**Cost-cutting that breaks something.** Aggressive rightsizing without testing causes outages. The cost of an outage is usually larger than the savings.

**Optimization that takes more time than it saves.** A team spends a quarter saving $5K/year. Math doesn't work. Focus on opportunities where savings exceed effort.

**Renewal autopilot.** Annual renewals go through without review. Calendar them.

**No tagging.** Cloud spend grows; no one knows whose. Tag everything from day one.

**Free tier overruns.** "It's on the free tier." Then it's not, and bills surprise. Set alerts on free-tier services.

**No environment differentiation.** Production-grade staging "to match prod." Costs as much as prod. Often unnecessary.

**Untouched legacy.** "The old project still runs." Why? Often: nothing actually uses it. Audit and shut down.

**Premium tiers for non-premium needs.** Enterprise plan because someone wanted a feature that's been since added to lower tiers. Recheck.

**Vendor lock-in justifying cost.** "We can't switch." That's not a reason to overpay; it's a strategic problem to plan around.

**Optimizing the small stuff while ignoring the big stuff.** Saving $50/month on tools while $5K/month sits in oversized infrastructure. Top-down first.

**Penny-wise, pound-foolish.** Cutting a useful tool to save $20/month, then losing hours to manual work. Tools that pay for themselves shouldn't be cut.

**No reinvestment.** Every dollar saved goes to bottom line; nothing reinvested in upgrades or capacity. Saved costs and improved capability aren't either/or.
