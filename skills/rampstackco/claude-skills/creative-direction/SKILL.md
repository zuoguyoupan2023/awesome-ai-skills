description: "Walk the user through four directional axes (tone register, aesthetic philosophy, audience relationship, sensory ambition) and produce a structured aesthetic brief that downstream content, copy, design, and art-direction skills consume as required input. The aesthetic depth layer, distinct from `creative-brief` (operational kickoff: scope, audience, deliverables, constraints). Use when a project needs aesthetic coherence across many small decisions and the user has only a vague feeling, or when multiple downstream aesthetic-producing skills need a shared brief. Triggers on creative direction, aesthetic direction, set the aesthetic, define the visual direction, what's the vibe, what's the tone, the four axes. Does NOT fire for a general kickoff brief (use `creative-brief`), tactical single-piece work, already-documented direction, purely functional output, or locked production-stage work."

# Creative Direction

Frameworks produce competent output. Coherent output requires a brief.

This skill turns vague creative intent into a structured brief that downstream skills can reference. It does not generate taste. It captures direction, so the dozens of small decisions a project requires (word choice, image selection, white space, sequencing, what to leave out) all answer to the same question.

---

> Worked examples for each axis position can be assembled from any reference brand library that documents tone, aesthetic, audience relationship, and sensory ambition consistently. The framework below describes the four axes; the user's own reference set positions each example along the axes during the brief workflow.

## When to use

- The start of a multi-touchpoint project (website, brand, campaign, product launch) where aesthetic coherence matters
- Before running multiple downstream skills that need to share a unified voice and look
- When inheriting a project that has competent execution but feels generic or incoherent
- Recalibrating an existing project that has drifted aesthetically over time
- When the user is a non-curator who knows what feeling they want but cannot articulate the decisions that produce it

## When NOT to use

- Use `creative-brief` instead when the user needs a general kickoff brief covering scope, audience, deliverables, and constraints. This skill goes deeper on aesthetic axes specifically, not on the operational layer.
- Use `art-direction` instead when briefing a specific creative deliverable (photo shoot, illustration set, video, campaign). This skill produces project-wide aesthetic direction; `art-direction` extends that direction into specific creative work.
- Tactical single-piece work (one tweet, one error message, one button label)
- Projects where the user has complete aesthetic direction documented already (skip to downstream skills)
- Purely functional output (data tables, form labels, system status text)
- Production-stage execution where direction is already locked
- When the goal is to develop taste; this skill codifies intent, it does not develop judgment

---

## Required inputs

- Project name and one-paragraph description
- Target audience (rough is fine; full audience profiles come from `brand-discovery`)
- Business goal (what changes if this project works)
- Optional but high-value: 2 to 4 reference URLs (sites, brands, or pieces) the user admires, with a sentence on what specifically resonates
- Optional: existing brand assets if the project is a refresh, not greenfield
- Constraints worth declaring (parent brand voice, regulatory tone requirements, accessibility floors)

## The framework: 4 directional axes

A creative brief sits at the intersection of four axes. Each axis is a spectrum, not a binary. The user picks a position on each, knowing that the choice excludes adjacent positions for this project.

### 1. Tone Register

How formal is the work? How much heat does the language carry?

**Positions:**

- **Professional.** Measured, precise, low-register. Trusts the reader to do work. Restraint is the signal.
- **Conversational.** Warmer, more personal, comfortable with first-person and contractions. Reads like a thoughtful person talking.
- **Playful.** Wit, surprise, willingness to break form for effect. Risks the reader missing the point if not earned.
- **Provocative.** Pointed, opinionated, willing to take a position other brands will not. Risks alienating people who do not share the position.

**How to choose:** What does the audience already get too much of, and what too little? If the category is dry, conversational or playful is differentiation. If the category is loud, professional restraint is differentiation.

### 2. Aesthetic Philosophy

How much visual density does the work carry? How much does each element earn its place?

**Positions:**

- **Editorial Restrained.** Generous white space, single definitive image instead of grids, considered typography, low color count. Signals confidence and patience.
- **Polished Standard.** Modern SaaS aesthetic. Clean grids, balanced contrast, expected proportions. Signals competence and professionalism.
- **Controlled Maximalist.** High visual density where every element is intentional. Loud but engineered. Signals craft and conviction.
- **Expressive Maximalist.** Visual abundance, willingness to be loud, willing to clash. Signals energy and ambition. Hardest to execute well.

**How to choose:** What is the project saying about the brand's relationship to attention? Restrained earns attention by deserving it. Maximalist captures attention by not letting it leave.

### 3. Audience Relationship

How does the brand position itself relative to the reader?

**Positions:**

- **Authority.** We tell you what is true. Implicit hierarchy, expertise on display, reader is the learner.
- **Peer.** We are figuring this out together. Equal footing, shared vocabulary, reader is the co-thinker.
- **Companion.** We walk with you. Lower hierarchy than authority, more presence than peer, reader is the protagonist of their own work.
- **Coach.** We challenge you. The brand pushes the reader toward something they would not push themselves toward alone, reader is the trainee.

**How to choose:** What does the audience need most? Audiences who feel lost want authority or coach. Audiences who feel patronized want peer or companion. The wrong choice patronizes or abandons the reader.

### 4. Sensory Ambition

How much is the work asking of the reader emotionally?

**Positions:**

- **Functional.** Get a job done. Reader gets in, gets the answer, gets out. Aesthetics serve clarity. Most utility tools live here.
- **Considered.** Reader notices the craft. Aesthetic choices are visible without being the point. Most premium brands live here.
- **Resonant.** Reader feels something specific the brand architected. Aesthetics carry meaning. Hardest to produce. Most editorial and narrative brands aspire here.

**How to choose:** What does the audience deserve from this experience? Functional respects time. Resonant respects feeling. The wrong choice either wastes attention or fails to deliver utility.

---

## Workflow

1. **Gather inputs.** Project name, description, audience, goal, references.
2. **Walk through each axis as a question.** One axis at a time. For each, present the positions, surface tradeoffs, and capture the user's selection plus reasoning.
3. **Capture inspiration references.** For each provided reference URL, ask what specifically resonates. The answer often clarifies which axis position fits better than abstract description does.
4. **Surface tensions.** Some combinations are difficult to execute well. Functional + Provocative is rare since provocation usually requires emotional engagement that pure functional work resists. Authority + Functional often slides into preachy without warming up at least slightly. Flag tensions and ask the user to confirm or reconsider.
5. **Synthesize.** Write a one-paragraph synthesis describing what this combination produces in practice.
6. **Output the brief.** Markdown format using the structure in [`references/brief-template.md`](references/brief-template.md). The brief becomes a project artifact (typically saved as `BRIEF.md` at the project root).
7. **Hand off.** Reference the brief in any downstream skill that produces aesthetic output. Required reading before `landing-page-copy`, `art-direction`, `content-and-copy`, `brand-style-guide`, or any other skill where coherence matters.

## Failure patterns

- **Using this to develop taste.** This skill codifies intent. It does not produce judgment. A user with no taste who runs this still produces incoherent work; the brief just makes the incoherence consistent.
- **Skipping inspiration references.** The references calibrate what the axis positions mean in practice. A user picking "Editorial Restrained" without examples often means something different than what an art director means by it.
- **Treating positions as absolute.** A project at "Conversational" still has moments of authority and play. Position is the gravitational center, not a fence.
- **Brief drift mid-project.** The most common failure. The brief gets written, then ignored. Discipline: every downstream skill checks the brief before producing output. If a skill wants to violate the brief, the violation is a decision the user makes consciously, not an accident.
- **Picking incompatible combinations without flagging.** Functional + Provocative is technically valid but very hard. The skill should surface that the combination is rare and ask the user to confirm.
- **Producing a brief no one references.** A brief that does not change downstream output is decoration. The test of a good brief is whether the output would be different if a different brief were used.

---

## Output format

Default output is a markdown brief, typically saved as `BRIEF.md` at the project root.

Structure:

1. **Project header.** Name, one-paragraph description, target audience, business goal.
2. **The four axis selections.** Each axis with the position selected and a one-sentence rationale.
3. **Synthesis paragraph.** What this combination produces in practice. Written in present tense, not aspirational ("This brief produces work that..." not "This brief will help us...").
4. **Inspiration references.** The provided URLs with notes on what specifically each one demonstrates.
5. **Rejection list.** What this brief explicitly says no to. Often the most useful section. Examples: "No testimonial walls. No stock photography. No exclamation marks."
6. **Open questions.** Anything still unresolved that downstream skills will need to know.

The brief is reference material for the project's life, not a one-time deliverable. Update it when the project's direction genuinely changes. Resist the urge to update it when execution is hard; usually that means execute harder, not loosen the brief.
