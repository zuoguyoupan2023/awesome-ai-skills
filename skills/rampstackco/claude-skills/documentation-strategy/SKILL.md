# Documentation Strategy

Decide what gets documented, where, by whom, and how it stays fresh. Stack-agnostic. Applies to internal team docs, product docs, runbooks, READMEs, and knowledge bases.

---

## When to use

- Setting up documentation for a new team or product
- Auditing existing documentation
- Fixing stale or scattered docs
- Choosing a documentation tool or platform
- Defining what gets documented and what doesn't
- Establishing maintenance cadence
- Scoping technical writing work
- Designing onboarding documentation (use alongside `team-onboarding-playbook`)

## When NOT to use

- Writing the actual content of a single document (use `content-and-copy`)
- Customer-facing knowledge base copy (use `content-strategy`)
- Code comments and inline documentation (covered by `code-review-web`)
- One-off blog posts or articles (use `content-and-copy`)

---

## Required inputs

- The audience (internal, external, customer, dev, exec)
- Existing docs and their state (where, what shape, last updated)
- Team size and growth trajectory
- The kinds of work that produce documentation (engineering, product, ops, support)
- Tools currently in use

---

## The framework: 4 categories of documentation

Different categories of doc serve different purposes. Conflating them is how docs get bad.

### Category 1: Reference

What things are. Looked up when needed.

Examples: API reference, configuration options, glossary, architecture diagrams, contact lists, decision log entries.

Properties:
- Comprehensive
- Fact-checked, kept accurate
- Searchable
- Stable structure (links don't break)
- Version-aware where relevant

### Category 2: How-to

How to do specific tasks. Procedural.

Examples: "Deploy to staging," "Reset a password," "Onboard a new contractor," "Run the backup restore drill."

Properties:
- Step-by-step
- Tested by someone who didn't write it
- Includes the prerequisites
- Includes troubleshooting
- Versioned to the system it documents

### Category 3: Explanation

Why things are the way they are. Conceptual.

Examples: architecture rationale, design decision records (ADRs), strategy docs, vision documents.

Properties:
- Narrative
- Captures context (the why)
- Often historical (why we built it this way)
- Links to evidence

### Category 4: Tutorial

Learning-oriented. Walks someone from zero to capable.

Examples: "Getting started with our codebase," "Your first deploy," onboarding pathways.

Properties:
- Sequenced from simple to complex
- Hands-on
- Doesn't assume prior knowledge in scope
- Has clear completion criteria

(This four-way split is the Diátaxis framework, well-known in tech writing. Memorize it.)

---

## The framework: 5 tiers of doc

Different docs serve different audiences with different stakes.

### Tier 1: Customer-facing

Public docs, customer KBs, API references. High visibility, slow change.

Standards:
- Editorial review
- Version control
- Clear ownership
- High freshness bar
- Tied to release

### Tier 2: Cross-team / shared

Docs used across teams: shared APIs, common services, company-wide processes.

Standards:
- Cross-team ownership clear
- Update obligations on changes
- Mid-to-high freshness bar

### Tier 3: Team-internal

Docs for the team that owns them: how the team works, runbooks, decisions.

Standards:
- Team-owned, team-maintained
- Mid freshness bar
- Useful for the next person joining

### Tier 4: Personal scratchpad

Notes, drafts, work-in-progress. Not for others.

Standards:
- Low maintenance
- Don't link from official docs
- Promote to higher tier when valuable

### Tier 5: Auto-generated

Docs derived from code: API references generated from comments, schemas, etc.

Standards:
- Generation is automated, runs in CI
- Single source of truth (the code)
- Reviewed for usability, not freshness (that's automatic)

The tiering matters because the maintenance bar differs. Asking team-internal docs to meet customer-facing standards is wasteful and unsustainable.

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Audit current state

- What docs exist?
- Where do they live? (often: scattered)
- Who owns each?
- How fresh are they?
- Are they actually used? (check page views or referrals if measurable)

The audit is often eye-opening. Most teams have more docs than they realize, in more places than they realize.

### Step 2: Categorize and tier

For each doc:
- Category (reference / how-to / explanation / tutorial)
- Tier (customer / shared / team / scratchpad / generated)

Some docs are mixed. Note the dominant category.

### Step 3: Identify gaps

What documentation does the team need that doesn't exist?

Common gaps:
- "How does X actually work?" no answer
- Onboarding for the role no one's onboarded recently
- Runbook for a system that's never broken (yet)
- Decision rationale for "why are we doing it this way"

Ask people what they wish were documented. They know.

### Step 4: Identify dead weight

Docs that are:
- Out of date and not getting updated
- Duplicated across places (one is canonical, others should redirect or be deleted)
- About things that no longer exist
- Drafts abandoned long ago

Delete or archive. Stale docs are worse than missing docs (people might trust them).

### Step 5: Pick the home(s)

Where docs live affects whether they're maintained.

Common locations:
- **Code repo (markdown):** for docs tightly coupled to code (READMEs, ADRs, runbooks for the service)
- **Wiki / Notion / Confluence:** for cross-team and team-internal
- **Docs site (Docusaurus, Mintlify, custom):** for customer-facing
- **Tickets / decision logs:** for ephemeral records

Don't aim for one home. Aim for a clear answer to "where does this kind of doc live?"

### Step 6: Establish ownership

Every doc has an owner. Without an owner, it goes stale.

Owner can be:
- A team
- A role (the on-call rotation, the PM, the EM)
- A person, with a backup

If an owner isn't obvious, the doc may not deserve to exist.

### Step 7: Establish maintenance cadence

Per tier:

| Tier | Review cadence |
|---|---|
| Customer-facing | Per release, plus quarterly |
| Cross-team | Quarterly |
| Team-internal | Quarterly |
| Personal scratchpad | None |
| Auto-generated | On every change |

Maintenance includes:
- Verify accuracy
- Update for changed systems
- Archive what's no longer relevant
- Address user feedback

### Step 8: Make doc updates part of work

Documentation isn't a separate project. It's part of the work that produces it.

- New feature: docs are part of the feature
- New process: doc is part of the rollout
- Decision made: ADR or decision-log entry filed
- Bug postmortem: runbook updated
- New hire: onboarding doc updated based on their experience

The team that ships features without docs has less than they think they have.

### Step 9: Make docs discoverable

Even great docs are useless if no one finds them.

- Search that actually works (most platforms; some better than others)
- Index pages for major topics
- Cross-links between related docs
- Search aliases for common alternative phrasings
- Pinning the most-used docs

### Step 10: Measure

What's measurable depends on the platform:
- Page views
- Search queries (and zero-result queries)
- "Was this helpful?" feedback
- Time on page
- Referral patterns

For internal docs, the qualitative measure is often more useful: are the same questions getting asked over and over? If yes, the docs aren't doing their job (either they don't exist, aren't found, or aren't clear).

---

## Specific patterns

### README per project

Every code repo has a README that answers:
- What is this?
- How do I run it?
- How do I contribute?
- Where do I find more info?

Five sentences each, often. Length isn't the goal. The READ-it-ME promise is.

### ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

Per significant decision:

```
# ADR-NNN: [Title]

Status: [Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded]
Date: [Date]

## Context
[What's the situation? What forces are at play?]

## Decision
[What was decided?]

## Consequences
[What happens because of this decision? Both good and bad.]
```

ADRs accumulate. They become the explanation layer for "why are we doing it this way."

### Runbook

Per system:
- What it is
- How to access it
- Common operations (with commands)
- Common failure modes
- Restore from backup procedure
- Escalation contacts

See `incident-response` and `backup-and-disaster-recovery` for runbook standards.

### Onboarding pathway

Per role:
- Day 1
- Week 1
- Month 1
- 90 days

See `team-onboarding-playbook`.

### Decision log

Lightweight version of ADRs. Date, decision, decider, why. Keeps a record without ceremony.

### Glossary

Terms that have specific meaning in the team or product. Reduces confusion. Trains AI tools too (more on that later).

---

## Tooling

The tool is less important than the discipline. That said:

| Tool category | Examples | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| Wiki | Notion, Confluence, GitBook | Cross-team, internal |
| Markdown in code | GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket | READMEs, ADRs, technical |
| Docs sites | Docusaurus, Mintlify, ReadMe | Customer-facing, public docs |
| Internal sites | MkDocs, custom | Team-specific patterns |

Considerations:
- Search quality (a poor search makes everything worse)
- Editor quality (people won't write in painful editors)
- Version control (can you see history?)
- Permissions (right people can read and write)
- API and integration (for automation)
- Cost at your scale

For small teams: a single wiki tool is plenty. For larger: tiered tools.

---

## AI-related notes

LLMs and AI assistants increasingly read documentation. Some considerations:

- Clear, consistent structure helps both humans and AI
- A glossary of terms helps both
- File-level metadata (front matter) helps tools
- Public docs may be read by AI crawlers; consider an `llms.txt` if relevant
- AI-generated drafts are a starting point, not a final answer; humans review

---

## Failure patterns

**Documentation as a "later" task.** Always written later. Later means never. Make docs part of the work.

**One mega-doc for everything.** Wiki page that's 8,000 words. No one reads it. Break by category and topic.

**Stale docs that nobody trusts.** "Probably out of date" is the thought that kills documentation. Either keep current or archive.

**Docs everyone agrees should exist but no one writes.** The team agrees onboarding docs would be valuable. Months pass. No one writes them. Make ownership specific.

**Wikis that are graveyards.** Lots of pages, no one trusts any of them. Audit, archive, restart with a slimmer set.

**Docs separated from code.** API docs in a wiki, code in a repo. They drift. Co-locate.

**Docs without examples.** Reference without examples is hard to use. Examples make it concrete.

**Examples that don't run.** Code examples that worked once, drifted. Test examples in CI where possible.

**Long-form when reference would do.** A 2,000-word doc explaining what a 30-row table would. Use the right form.

**Multiple sources of truth.** Same info in three places, all slightly different. Pick canonical, redirect others.

**Doc tools no one uses.** Adopted because of a feature; team doesn't actually use it. Pick tools the team will use.

**Doc style guide that's longer than the docs.** Process beats product. Guide should be short.

**No way to mark docs as deprecated.** Old docs sit alongside current ones with no indication. Add a "deprecated" or "archived" status.

**No analytics.** No idea what's being used or what's missing. Even basic page views inform priorities.

**Docs that read like specifications.** Dense, formal, hard to scan. Write for the reader.

---

## Output format

A documentation strategy document includes:

- **Audit:** what exists, where, in what state
- **Tiering and categorization:** the framework applied to existing docs
- **Gap list:** what should exist but doesn't
- **Tool decisions:** where each kind of doc lives
- **Ownership map:** who owns what
- **Maintenance cadence:** what's reviewed when
- **Style guide (brief):** consistency standards
- **Roadmap:** prioritized work to fill gaps and close out dead weight
