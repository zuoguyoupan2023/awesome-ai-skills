# Performance Optimization

Diagnose web performance issues and produce a remediation plan. Stack-agnostic. Anchored to Core Web Vitals and standard browser performance patterns.

This skill goes deeper than the performance checks in `qa-testing` and `seo-technical`. Use this when performance itself is the goal.

---

## When to use

- Fixing Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS)
- Diagnosing slow page loads
- Reducing JavaScript bundle size
- Optimizing images, fonts, and other assets
- Fixing layout shift, render-blocking resources, jank
- Pre-launch performance verification
- Annual performance health check

## When NOT to use

- General QA after deploys (use `qa-testing`)
- Technical SEO including indexing and crawling (use `seo-technical`)
- Code review for general bugs (use `code-review-web`)

---

## Required inputs

- The site or page under audit
- Specific performance complaints if any
- Target metrics (Core Web Vitals thresholds, Lighthouse score, custom)
- Browser dev tools access
- Performance monitoring data if available (Real User Monitoring, lab data)

---

## The framework: Core Web Vitals

Three metrics carry most of the weight for both user experience and SEO:

### LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)

**What it measures:** Time until the largest visible content element finishes rendering.

**Targets:**
- Good: under 2.5 seconds
- Needs improvement: 2.5 to 4.0 seconds
- Poor: over 4.0 seconds

**Common causes of poor LCP:**
- Slow server response time (TTFB over 800ms)
- Render-blocking JavaScript or CSS
- Large unoptimized images for the LCP element
- Late-loading fonts that delay text render
- Client-side rendering of the LCP element

**Common fixes:**
- Server-render the LCP element (no client-side render)
- Optimize the LCP image (right format, right size, preloaded)
- Reduce render-blocking resources (defer non-critical CSS and JS)
- Use modern image formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Specify image dimensions to skip layout pass

### INP (Interaction to Next Paint)

**What it measures:** Responsiveness to user interactions. Replaces FID as the standard interactivity metric.

**Targets:**
- Good: under 200ms
- Needs improvement: 200 to 500ms
- Poor: over 500ms

**Common causes of poor INP:**
- Long-running JavaScript blocking the main thread
- Heavy event handlers
- Excessive React/framework re-renders
- Synchronous operations in event handlers
- Large DOM with expensive layouts

**Common fixes:**
- Break long tasks into chunks (`scheduler.yield()` or `setTimeout`)
- Memoize expensive computations
- Debounce or throttle high-frequency event handlers (scroll, mousemove, input)
- Avoid synchronous storage or DOM operations in handlers
- Reduce DOM size (under 1500 elements ideal)
- Use CSS over JS for animations where possible

### CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)

**What it measures:** How much the page jumps around as it loads. Unexpected layout shifts hurt usability.

**Targets:**
- Good: under 0.1
- Needs improvement: 0.1 to 0.25
- Poor: over 0.25

**Common causes of poor CLS:**
- Images without explicit dimensions
- Ads, embeds, iframes that load late
- Dynamically injected content above existing content
- Web fonts causing FOIT/FOUT (flash of invisible/unstyled text)
- CSS that depends on JS-loaded data

**Common fixes:**
- Always specify `width` and `height` (or `aspect-ratio`) on images and videos
- Reserve space for ads and embeds before they load
- Use `font-display: optional` or `font-display: swap` thoughtfully
- Avoid injecting content above the fold after initial render
- Preload critical fonts

---

## Beyond Core Web Vitals

### Time to First Byte (TTFB)

The server response time. Bad TTFB makes everything else worse.

**Targets:** under 800ms ideal.

**Common causes:**
- Slow database queries on the request path
- N+1 query patterns
- Missing caching
- Server geographic distance from users (no CDN)
- Cold starts on serverless

**Fixes:**
- Cache database queries
- Use a CDN for static and cacheable dynamic content
- Optimize critical-path queries
- Pre-render where possible (SSG, ISR)
- Edge functions for low-latency dynamic content

### Bundle size

JavaScript shipped to the browser.

**Targets:**
- Initial JS under 170KB compressed for typical pages
- Lazy-loaded chunks under 100KB compressed each

**Common causes of bloat:**
- Importing entire libraries when only one function is used
- Bundling polyfills for modern browsers
- Including dev-only code in production
- Duplicate dependencies (multiple versions of the same library)
- Large client-side state (Redux store snapshots, etc.)

**Fixes:**
- Tree-shake imports (`import { fn } from 'lib'` not `import lib from 'lib'`)
- Code-split per route
- Lazy-load below-the-fold components
- Audit dependencies; replace heavy ones (e.g., moment.js → date-fns or native Intl)
- Build-time bundle analyzer to spot bloat
- Dynamic imports for rarely-used features

### Image optimization

Images are typically 60 to 80 percent of page weight.

**Best practices:**
- Modern formats: WebP everywhere supported, AVIF where supported
- Responsive images: `srcset` for different viewport sizes
- Lazy loading: `loading="lazy"` for below-the-fold
- Explicit dimensions: prevents CLS
- Right size: don't ship 4000px images for 800px display
- LCP image: preload, never lazy-load

### Font loading

Web fonts often delay text render and cause CLS.

**Best practices:**
- Self-host fonts (avoid third-party blocking)
- Preload critical fonts (`<link rel="preload" as="font">`)
- Use `font-display: swap` for non-critical fonts
- Subset fonts to remove unused glyphs
- Use variable fonts where possible
- Provide system-font fallback that visually matches

### Third-party scripts

Third parties (analytics, ads, chat widgets) often dominate performance budgets.

**Audit each:**
- Is it required?
- Can it load after page interaction (defer)?
- Can it run from a worker (off main thread)?
- Is the third party itself fast?
- Are there lighter-weight alternatives?

A common pattern: 50 percent of performance issues come from third-party scripts.

## Workflow

1. **Establish a baseline.** Lighthouse scan, WebPageTest run, or Real User Monitoring data. Capture current Core Web Vitals.
2. **Identify the worst offender.** LCP, INP, or CLS - which is failing? Focus there first.
3. **Diagnose specifically.** Browser dev tools (Performance tab, Network tab, Coverage tab). Identify the actual cause of the metric failure.
4. **Plan fixes.** Per identified issue, plan a specific change. Estimate impact and effort.
5. **Implement.** One fix at a time where possible. Easier to measure impact.
6. **Re-measure.** After each major fix, re-run Lighthouse and check Real User Monitoring.
7. **Iterate.** Performance is rarely solved in one pass. Plan for ongoing monitoring and fixes.

---

## Tools

**Lab tools** (run on demand):
- Lighthouse (built into Chrome DevTools)
- PageSpeed Insights (online)
- WebPageTest (online, more configurable)
- Browser Performance tab (deep flame graph analysis)

**Field tools** (real user data):
- Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX) - public data for any site
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) - your own users (DataDog, New Relic, custom, etc.)
- Search Console Core Web Vitals report

Lab tools are useful for diagnosis. Field tools are the source of truth for what users actually experience.

---

## Failure patterns

- **Optimizing without measuring.** Performance theater without baseline metrics. Always measure first.
- **Optimizing the wrong metric.** A great Lighthouse score with bad real-user metrics means your test conditions don't match users.
- **Over-optimizing.** Spending weeks shaving 10ms off TTFB while CLS is 0.4. Fix the worst offender first.
- **Lighthouse-driven optimization only.** Lighthouse runs in idealized conditions. Always check field data.
- **Single-page optimization.** Performance regressions creep in across the codebase. Build performance budgets and CI checks.
- **Treating every byte as equal.** A render-blocking 100KB script is worse than a deferred 500KB script.
- **Bundle size obsession.** Bundle size matters, but execution time matters more. A small bundle that takes 5 seconds to parse is worse than a larger bundle that runs fast.
- **Ignoring third parties.** "It's the analytics tag, not us." Third parties run on your domain in your users' eyes. Own them.
