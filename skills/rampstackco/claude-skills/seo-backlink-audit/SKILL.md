# SEO Backlink Audit

Audit a backlink profile using data pulled from the Ahrefs MCP. Stack-agnostic. Produces a profile health assessment, a toxic link list (if needed), a reclamation list, and a gap analysis against competitors.

---

## When to use

- Periodic backlink health check (quarterly or biannual)
- Recovering from a Google manual action or unnatural link warning
- Scoping a disavow file
- Pre-acquisition due diligence on link equity
- Planning a link building campaign (need a baseline)
- Investigating ranking drops correlated with link loss
- Recovering lost links after a migration or replatform

## When NOT to use

- Building new links (use `seo-offpage`)
- General SEO audits (use `seo-audit-orchestration`)
- Keyword opportunity analysis (use `seo-keyword-gap-audit`)
- Technical issues unrelated to links (use `seo-site-health-audit`)

---

## Required inputs

- Target property (root domain, subdomain, or URL prefix)
- Competitor set (3-5 properties with comparable strategies)
- Time window (typically last 12-24 months)
- Confirmation Ahrefs MCP is connected and has access to the property
- Search Console manual action status (if any)
- Recent SEO history (migrations, link campaigns, penalties)

---

## The framework: 5 dimensions of a backlink profile

A profile is healthy when all five dimensions are healthy. Issues in any one can cap rankings or invite penalties.

### Dimension 1: Referring domain quality

Volume of links matters less than the quality and relevance of the linking domains.

Pull from Ahrefs:

- Total referring domains (current and trended)
- Domain Rating distribution (DR bands)
- Topical relevance of linking domains
- Geographic distribution (where appropriate)
- Domain age and trust signals

Healthy signal: a long tail of relevant, established domains. Concentration in any single source is a risk.

### Dimension 2: Link velocity

How fast links are gained or lost.

Pull from Ahrefs:

- New referring domains per month (trended 12-24 months)
- Lost referring domains per month
- Net change

Healthy signal: steady positive growth. Sudden spikes suggest paid campaigns or negative SEO. Sudden drops correlate with redirect mistakes, content removal, or the linking sites going down.

### Dimension 3: Anchor text distribution

The mix of anchor types tells search engines what the property is about and whether the profile looks natural.

Categories to map:

- Branded (the brand name)
- Naked URL
- Generic ("click here", "this page")
- Exact-match keyword
- Partial-match keyword
- Image (alt text or none)

Healthy signal: branded and naked URL anchors dominate. Exact-match keyword anchors are a small minority. Heavy exact-match concentration triggers spam filters.

### Dimension 4: Link types

Not all links are equal.

Categories:

- Dofollow versus nofollow
- Editorial versus directory or comment
- In-content versus footer or sidebar
- Sponsored or UGC tagged
- Redirect chains
- Lost links recoverable via outreach

Healthy signal: editorial in-content dofollow links from relevant sites dominate.

### Dimension 5: Competitive gap

What links do peers have that you do not?

Pull from Ahrefs:

- Domains linking to 2+ competitors but not the target
- Domains linking to 1 competitor with high relevance to the target
- Top performing competitor pages by referring domain count

Healthy signal: the gap is shrinking over time. A widening gap is a strategic risk.

## Workflow

1. **Charter the audit.** Goal, scope, time window, competitor set.
2. **Pull baseline data.** Referring domains, anchor text, link types, lost links, competitor overlap.
3. **Map the profile across 5 dimensions.** One section per dimension.
4. **Identify red flags.** Velocity spikes, anchor concentration, low-DR concentration, suspect TLDs, repeated footprints.
5. **Build the toxic list (if needed).** Use the criteria in [`references/toxic-link-criteria.md`](references/toxic-link-criteria.md).
6. **Build the reclamation list.** Lost links worth recovering via outreach.
7. **Build the gap list.** Domains linking to peers, prioritized by relevance.
8. **Synthesize.** Profile health verdict, top 3 risks, top 3 opportunities.
9. **Recommend.** Disavow (rare), reclamation outreach, link building targets, monitoring cadence.
10. **Document and hand off.** Outputs feed `seo-offpage` and `seo-audit-orchestration`.

---

## Failure patterns

- **Disavow happy.** Most profiles do not need a disavow. Disavowing legitimate links damages rankings. Use it only after a manual action or clear algorithmic signals.
- **Counting links instead of evaluating them.** A profile with 10,000 referring domains can be weaker than one with 200 high-quality editorial links.
- **Ignoring lost links.** Recovering a lost link is faster and cheaper than building a new one.
- **No competitor benchmark.** Profile health is relative. A "low" backlink count for a tier-1 competitor is a "great" count for a niche site.
- **Anchor text panic.** A high exact-match percentage in absolute terms is fine for niche sites where the brand and keyword overlap. Investigate before disavowing.
- **One-time audit.** Profile health drifts. Audit on a cadence (quarterly minimum for active properties).
- **Treating Ahrefs as ground truth.** Ahrefs sees most links but not all. Triangulate with Search Console for completeness.
- **Over-indexing on Domain Rating.** DR is a relative metric, not a quality signal. A DR-30 niche site can be more valuable than a DR-80 generalist.

## Output format

A backlink audit document with:

1. **Executive summary.** Profile health verdict and top risks.
2. **Profile snapshot.** Key metrics: referring domains, DR distribution, anchor mix, velocity.
3. **5-dimension analysis.** One section per dimension with findings.
4. **Toxic link list.** If needed. Disavow file ready format.
5. **Reclamation list.** Lost links worth recovering, with contact paths.
6. **Gap list.** Top 50 domains linking to competitors but not target.
7. **Recommendations.** Disavow (Y/N), reclamation outreach plan, link building targets.
8. **Methodology.** Data sources, pull dates, criteria used.

Length: 8-15 pages depending on profile complexity.
