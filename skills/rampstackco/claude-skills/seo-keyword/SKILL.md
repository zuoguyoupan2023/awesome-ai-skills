# Keyword Research

Find the queries worth ranking for, classify them by intent, cluster them into topics, and prioritize what to produce. Stack-agnostic. Tool-agnostic (works with any keyword tool).

---

## When to use

- Starting a new site or content section
- Planning a content calendar
- Looking for ranking opportunities on an existing site
- Understanding search intent before writing
- Building topic clusters for internal linking
- Identifying content gaps vs competitors

## When NOT to use

- Optimizing a single page where the target query is already known (use `seo-onpage`)
- Comparing your site to a competitor across many dimensions (use `seo-competitor`)
- Auditing existing content for performance (use `seo-content-audit`)

---

## Required inputs

- The site or topic area
- The target audience and what they need
- A keyword tool (Ahrefs, Semrush, Moz, Google Keyword Planner, or similar) OR access to search console for an existing site
- Optional: 3 to 5 known competitors to seed the research

If no tool is available, the skill still works using SERP inspection and search console data alone, but the volume estimates will be rough.

---

## The framework: 4 stages

### Stage 1: Discover

Cast a wide net. Sources:

- **Seed terms** from the brief or the user's vocabulary
- **Competitor keywords** (any keyword tool will export these)
- **Search console queries** for an existing site (find the page-1 and page-2 queries)
- **Related searches and "People also ask"** in actual SERPs
- **Customer language** (support tickets, sales calls, reviews)
- **Forum and community language** (Reddit, niche forums, Stack Overflow)

Goal: 200 to 500 candidate keywords for a typical content sprint. More if planning a year of content.

### Stage 2: Classify by intent

Every keyword maps to one of four intents. Get this right or the rest is noise.

| Intent | Signal | Page type that wins |
|---|---|---|
| **Informational** | "how to," "what is," "why," "best way to" | Article, guide, tutorial |
| **Navigational** | brand or product name + modifier | Brand homepage, product page |
| **Commercial** | "best," "review," "vs," "comparison," "alternatives" | Listicle, comparison, review |
| **Transactional** | "buy," "price," "deal," "near me," "for sale" | Product page, category page |

A keyword tool's volume tells you the demand. The SERP tells you the intent. When in doubt, look at what's actually ranking. If page 1 is articles, the query is informational. If page 1 is product pages, it's transactional.

**Hybrid intents exist.** "Best running shoes" is commercial-investigational. "Best running shoes under $100" is the same intent narrowed by a budget filter. Treat hybrids as their dominant intent and note the modifier.

### Stage 3: Cluster

Group keywords that should target the same page (or topic cluster).

Two clustering approaches:

**Approach A: SERP overlap.** If two keywords share at least 3 of the top 10 results, they target the same page. This is mechanical and reliable.

**Approach B: Topical relevance.** Group keywords by the underlying topic, not just word overlap. "How to start a podcast" and "podcast equipment for beginners" are the same topic, different facets.

Use both. A typical cluster has:
- 1 primary keyword (highest volume, broadest intent)
- 5 to 15 secondary keywords (variations and long-tails)
- 1 page that targets them all

### Stage 4: Prioritize

For each cluster, score on three dimensions:

**Opportunity** (1 to 5):
- Volume (raw search demand)
- Click potential (some queries answer themselves in the SERP, lowering CTR)
- Conversion potential (does this query attract buyers or browsers?)

**Difficulty** (1 to 5):
- Domain authority of top results
- Backlink count of top results
- Content depth and freshness of top results
- Whether the SERP has features (featured snippets, AI overview, video carousel) that compete with organic

**Strategic fit** (1 to 5):
- Does it serve our audience?
- Does it support our positioning?
- Does it link to commercial pages naturally?

**Priority score = Opportunity + Strategic fit - Difficulty.**

Rank the clusters. Top 20 percent get produced first.

## Workflow

1. **Define the scope.** What site, what topic area, what audience.
2. **Run discovery.** Pull seeds, competitor exports, search console data, SERP inspections. Aim for 200 to 500 candidates.
3. **Deduplicate and clean.** Remove obvious junk, brand misspellings, irrelevant terms.
4. **Classify by intent.** Mark each keyword.
5. **Cluster.** Group into topical clusters. Aim for 20 to 50 clusters.
6. **Score each cluster** on opportunity, difficulty, and strategic fit.
7. **Prioritize.** Rank by composite score. Identify the top 10 to 20 clusters to produce first.
8. **Output.** Use the template in [`references/keyword-research-template.md`](references/keyword-research-template.md).

## Failure patterns

- **Chasing volume without intent.** A 10,000-volume informational keyword does not drive purchases. Match query to commercial outcome.
- **Targeting impossibly competitive keywords.** New sites cannot rank for "credit cards." Find the underserved long-tail variant.
- **Ignoring search console.** Existing sites already rank for queries they did not target. These are the easiest wins.
- **Treating clusters as one-keyword-per-page.** A page can target 10 to 30 related keywords. One-keyword-per-page leads to thin, cannibalized content.
- **Ignoring SERP features.** A query with a featured snippet, AI overview, and a video carousel above the organic results may not be worth pursuing.
- **Static keyword research.** Search demand shifts. Refresh the research at least annually for evergreen sites, quarterly for fast-moving topics.

## Output format

Default output: a spreadsheet (CSV or sheet) with one row per keyword and one row per cluster, plus a markdown summary with the top 10 to 20 clusters detailed.

Recommended columns for the keyword sheet:

| Column | Source |
|---|---|
| Keyword | Discovery |
| Volume | Tool |
| Difficulty | Tool |
| Intent | Manual classification |
| SERP features | Manual or tool |
| Cluster | Stage 3 |
| Cluster role (primary/secondary) | Stage 3 |
| Opportunity score | Stage 4 |
| Strategic fit | Stage 4 |
| Priority | Composite |
| Notes | Free text |
