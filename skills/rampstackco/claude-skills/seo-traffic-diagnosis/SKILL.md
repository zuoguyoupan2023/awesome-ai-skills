# SEO Traffic Diagnosis

Diagnose why organic traffic moved (down, flat, or unexpectedly up) using Ahrefs MCP combined with Search Console and analytics data. Stack-agnostic. Produces a root-cause diagnosis and an action plan.

---

## When to use

- Organic traffic dropped sharply
- Organic traffic has been flat for months despite content investment
- After a known Google algorithm update
- After a migration, replatform, or domain change
- After a deploy that touched routing, redirects, or rendering
- When a competitor is visibly taking organic share
- When a single page dropped from a ranked position
- When stakeholders need an explanation, fast

## When NOT to use

- Routine performance reporting (use `analytics-strategy`)
- Pre-emptive content planning (use `seo-content-gap-audit`)
- Backlink-only investigations (use `seo-backlink-audit`)
- Technical issue triage outside of traffic concerns (use `seo-site-health-audit`)

---

## Required inputs

- Description of the symptom (what changed, when, magnitude)
- Date the change started (best estimate)
- Recent SEO history: deploys, migrations, content changes, link campaigns
- Access to Ahrefs MCP, Search Console, and analytics
- Confirmation the change is real (not a tracking artifact)

---

## The framework: 5 layers of diagnosis

A traffic change has one or more root causes. Move through the layers in order. Stop when you have enough evidence.

### Layer 1: Confirm the change is real

Before diagnosing, rule out:

- Tracking gaps (analytics outages, tag manager issues)
- Bot traffic changes
- Reporting comparison errors (different date ranges, wrong segment)
- Seasonality (compare year-over-year, not just month-over-month)
- Holiday or weekday effects

Cross-check Search Console clicks against analytics organic sessions. Significant divergence often points to a tracking issue, not a real traffic change.

### Layer 2: Localize the change

Where is the change happening?

Segment by:

- Country and language
- Device (mobile, desktop, tablet)
- Page or section (homepage, blog, product, category)
- Query type (branded vs non-branded)
- Landing page

A change in one segment requires different diagnosis than a change everywhere.

| Pattern | Likely cause |
| --- | --- |
| One country dropped | Local algorithm update, hreflang issue, geo redirect issue |
| Mobile dropped, desktop flat | Mobile usability or page speed regression |
| One section dropped | Topical algorithm update or section-specific quality issue |
| Branded queries dropped | Brand-level issue: site outage, reputation, manual action |
| Non-branded dropped | Algorithmic ranking issue |
| Single page dropped | Page-level issue: content, technical, or competitive |
| Sitewide dropped | Sitewide issue: penalty, technical, migration, or algorithm |

### Layer 3: Page-level analysis

For affected pages, audit:

- Position changes per ranked keyword (Ahrefs Rank Tracker history)
- SERP composition changes (more ads, AI overviews, featured snippets, video)
- Click-through rate changes
- Index status (Search Console coverage)
- Crawl errors and accessibility
- Recent content changes
- Internal link changes
- Backlink changes (lost links, redirect chains)

A page can lose traffic without losing rank if SERP composition changed.

### Layer 4: Technical analysis

Did anything break technically?

Check:

- Robots.txt changes
- Canonical tag changes
- Meta robots changes (accidental noindex)
- Redirect chains and loops
- Render issues (especially for JS-heavy frameworks)
- Site speed regressions
- Hreflang errors
- Sitemap freshness
- HTTP status codes (4xx, 5xx spikes)
- Server log evidence of crawl behavior changes

Recent deploys are the prime suspect. Compare deploy dates to traffic change dates.

### Layer 5: External analysis

If layers 1-4 do not explain the change, look outward.

- Algorithm update calendar (cross-reference timing)
- Competitor moves (new content, new SERP features they captured)
- Industry trend (declining search demand for the topic)
- Manual action (Search Console security and manual actions)
- Negative SEO (sudden link velocity changes)

External-factor diagnosis benefits from competitive context: did your traffic drop while competitors held steady (suggests an algorithm-specific issue), or did the entire vertical lose ground (suggests a user-behavior shift)? Similarweb shows competitor traffic trends; Ahrefs shows competitor SERP movement; pairing both surfaces whether the issue is yours alone or the category's.

## Workflow

1. **Confirm the symptom.** Get exact dates, magnitude, segment if known.
2. **Validate the data.** Layer 1 checks. Rule out tracking and seasonality.
3. **Localize.** Layer 2. Segment until the pattern is clear.
4. **Page-level dive.** Layer 3 on the most affected pages.
5. **Technical check.** Layer 4. Recent deploys, robots, canonicals, redirects.
6. **External check.** Layer 5. Algorithm updates, competitors, industry.
7. **Build the hypothesis.** State the cause as a single sentence.
8. **Validate the hypothesis.** Find the evidence that confirms or refutes it. See [`references/diagnosis-checklist.md`](references/diagnosis-checklist.md).
9. **Action plan.** Specific fixes mapped to specific evidence.
10. **Communicate.** Write up the diagnosis. Stakeholders want clarity, not exhaustive analysis.

## Failure patterns

- **Jumping to algorithm update.** "It must be the algorithm" is the lazy answer. Eliminate technical and page-level causes first.
- **Solving the wrong problem.** A drop diagnosed as "content quality" when the real cause was an accidental noindex on a deploy. Validate the hypothesis before fixing.
- **No baseline for "normal."** Without a baseline, every fluctuation looks alarming. Establish what normal noise looks like before reacting.
- **Treating one page as the site.** Site-wide and page-level diagnoses are different. Confirm scope first.
- **Ignoring branded vs non-branded.** A drop in branded queries means a brand-level problem. A drop in non-branded means an SEO problem. Different teams own them.
- **Comparing wrong date ranges.** Comparing 28 days to the previous 28 days during a holiday distorts the picture. Use year-over-year for seasonal businesses.
- **Stopping at correlation.** A deploy and a drop on the same day is a strong correlation, not proof. Find the mechanism.
- **Single-source diagnosis.** Ahrefs sees position. Search Console sees clicks and queries. Analytics sees behavior. Logs see crawl. Use them together.
- **Premature reassurance.** Telling stakeholders "it is just an algorithm update, will recover" without evidence sets up a worse conversation later.

## Output format

A diagnosis document with:

1. **Summary.** What changed, when, magnitude, root cause in one paragraph.
2. **The symptom.** Charts and segment breakdowns.
3. **Layer-by-layer findings.** What each layer ruled in or out.
4. **Root cause hypothesis.** Single statement with evidence.
5. **Action plan.** Ordered fixes with owners and timelines.
6. **Recovery forecast.** Realistic expectations on timeline and ceiling.
7. **Monitoring plan.** What to watch for confirmation of recovery.

Length: 4-10 pages. Stakeholders read this fast.
