# UX Research

Plan and execute user research that produces decisions, not just decks. Stack-agnostic. Tool-agnostic.

This skill is for generative and discovery research. For testing existing designs, use `usability-testing`. For mapping the full customer experience, use `journey-mapping`.

---

## When to use

- Starting a new product or major feature without sufficient user understanding
- Diagnosing why something isn't working without clear data signals
- Generating new opportunity hypotheses
- Validating a strategic direction before significant investment
- Building empathy across a team that's drifted from users
- Translating "we should talk to users" intent into a real plan

## When NOT to use

- Testing a specific design or prototype (use `usability-testing`)
- Mapping the full journey of an existing experience (use `journey-mapping`)
- Quantitative measurement (use `analytics-strategy`)
- Conversion testing (use `cro-optimization`)

---

## Required inputs

- The research question(s) - what you need to answer
- Stakeholder buy-in (who needs the findings, what decisions hinge on them)
- Access to users (current customers, prospects, lapsed users, target segments)
- Timeline and budget
- Any prior research to build on

---

## The framework: 6 phases

### 1. Frame the question

Bad questions produce bad research. Spend disproportionate time on framing.

**Good research questions:**
- Specific (not "How do users feel about our product?")
- Open-ended (not "Do users like feature X?")
- Decision-relevant (the answer changes what gets built)
- Researchable (can be answered through user contact, not just analysis)

**Examples:**

| Weak question | Better question |
|---|---|
| "Do users like our onboarding?" | "Where in onboarding do new users feel uncertain about whether to continue?" |
| "What features should we build?" | "What unmet needs do current users have when [specific job]?" |
| "Why is conversion low?" | "What's the user mental model when they reach the pricing page, and where does it diverge from our intent?" |

### 2. Choose the method

The method follows the question.

**Generative methods (what's true?):**

- **In-depth interviews.** 60 minutes, 5 to 15 participants. Best for understanding context, motivation, mental models.
- **Contextual inquiry.** Observe users in their environment doing their work. Best for workflow understanding.
- **Diary studies.** Participants log their experience over days/weeks. Best for behaviors that don't manifest in a single session.
- **Field research.** Spend time where users live/work. Best for cultural and contextual understanding.
- **Surveys (qualitative-heavy).** When you need broad signal with open-ended responses.

**Validation methods (is this hypothesis right?):**

- **Concept testing.** Show a description, mockup, or prototype. Get reactions.
- **Card sorts.** Validate information architecture.
- **Tree tests.** Validate findability without visual design influence.

(For testing usability of working designs, see `usability-testing`.)

### 3. Recruit

The recruit makes or breaks the research.

**Recruit criteria:**

- Match the audience the research targets (not "anyone willing")
- Mix of behaviors (active users, lapsed users, never-users)
- Mix of demographics where relevant
- Excludes friends, family, employees (biased)
- Excludes professional research participants if possible (different population)

**Recruit channels:**

- In-product recruiting (intercept current users)
- Email outreach to user segments
- Recruiting platforms (UserInterviews, Respondent, etc.)
- Customer support team referrals
- Field intercept for in-person

**Incentive:** Pay participants. Standard rates: $50 to $150 for 60 minutes, more for executives or specialized professions.

**Recruit volume:** Plan for 20 to 30 percent no-show. Recruit 7 to schedule 5.

### 4. Conduct

The interview or session itself.

**Pre-interview:**

- Send confirmation 24 hours and 1 hour before
- Test recording setup (audio quality is non-negotiable)
- Prepare interview guide (see template)
- Have a notetaker if possible (frees the interviewer to focus)

**During the interview:**

- Record video and audio (with consent)
- Open with rapport-building, not the research questions
- Use open-ended questions ("Tell me about the last time...")
- Use silence (let participants fill it; don't rush to the next question)
- Ask "why" but not too many times in a row (becomes interrogation)
- Ask for specifics and examples ("Can you walk me through what you did?")
- Probe contradictions gently ("Earlier you said X, now you're saying Y; help me understand")
- Watch for moments of emotion (often signal something important)
- Don't sell or convince - this is listening, not pitching

**Anti-patterns:**

- Leading questions ("Don't you find this confusing?")
- Hypothetical questions ("Would you use a feature that...?") - poor predictor of behavior
- Multiple questions at once
- Interrupting
- Filling silence
- Interviewing your hypothesis (only asking questions that confirm what you already think)

### 5. Synthesize

Notes don't become insights automatically.

**The synthesis process:**

1. **Capture observations.** From recordings, notes, transcripts. Each observation is a single data point: a quote, a behavior, an emotion, a moment.
2. **Affinity mapping.** Cluster observations into themes. Physical sticky notes or digital equivalents.
3. **Find patterns.** Themes that appear across multiple participants are signal. One-off observations are interesting but weaker.
4. **Identify insights.** An insight is more than a theme. It's a non-obvious finding that explains a why or implies a so what.
5. **Test the insight against the data.** If the insight only fits some interviews, it's a hypothesis, not an insight.
6. **Distinguish signal from noise.** A belief that 1 of 8 participants holds may be noise. A belief 6 of 8 hold is signal.

**Heuristics for strong insights:**

- They surprise the team (insights you already knew aren't insights)
- They explain a "why" the team has been guessing about
- They imply specific actions (so what?)
- They hold up across multiple data points
- They can be stated in one or two sentences

### 6. Communicate

Findings die in slide decks. Plan distribution.

**Outputs that work:**

- **Top-line insights document.** 5 to 10 insights, clearly stated, with supporting quotes.
- **Highlight reels.** Edited 5 to 10 minute video of key participant moments. More persuasive than any document.
- **In-room workshops.** Walk stakeholders through the synthesis themselves. They internalize when they participate.
- **Per-stakeholder briefs.** Different audiences need different framings. CEO wants strategic implications. Designers want pain points. Engineers want use cases.

**Outputs that fail:**

- 80-slide decks that get skimmed
- Reports that no one reads past the executive summary
- Verbose narrative summaries
- Insights that sit in a doc no one re-opens

---

## Workflow

1. **Frame the research question.** With stakeholders. Multiple iterations.
2. **Pick the method.** Match to the question.
3. **Plan logistics.** Timeline, budget, recruit, tools, team.
4. **Recruit.** Start early. Slow recruits delay everything.
5. **Pilot.** Run 1 to 2 sessions before the main batch. Refine the guide.
6. **Conduct.** Stay disciplined to the guide while staying open to surprises.
7. **Synthesize.** Don't wait until all sessions are done; start mid-way.
8. **Communicate.** Multiple formats. Multiple audiences.
9. **Track impact.** Did decisions change because of the research? If not, the research failed regardless of quality.

---

## Failure patterns

- **Research without a decision.** Findings have no home. Effort wasted.
- **Vague research questions.** Bad questions produce uninterpretable answers.
- **Recruiting "anyone willing."** Sample doesn't match audience.
- **Over-recruiting professional participants.** Pattern-matched answers, not real users.
- **Leading questions in the guide.** Findings reflect the researcher, not the user.
- **Skipping synthesis.** Notes alone aren't insights.
- **Insights that confirm the team's existing beliefs.** Suspect those especially.
- **Findings that never ship.** Research findings that don't change product decisions are decoration.
- **Single research project for years of decisions.** Research has a shelf life. Refresh.
- **Research as one-time project.** Continuous discovery beats episodic research.

## Output format

Default outputs:

1. **Research plan** (before research starts) - `research-plan-[topic].md`
2. **Interview guide** - `interview-guide-[topic].md`
3. **Findings doc** (after synthesis) - `research-findings-[topic].md`
4. **Highlight reel** (video, separately produced)

Findings document structure:

```markdown

## Top insights
