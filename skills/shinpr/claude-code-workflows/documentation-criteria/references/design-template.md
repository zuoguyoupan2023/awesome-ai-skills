## Acceptance Criteria (AC) - EARS Format

Each AC is written in EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format.
Keywords determine test type and reduce ambiguity.

**EARS Keywords**:
| Keyword | Usage | Test Type |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **When** | Event-triggered behavior | Event-driven test |
| **While** | State-dependent behavior | State condition test |
| **If-then** | Conditional behavior | Branch coverage test |
| (none) | Ubiquitous behavior | Basic functionality test |

**Format**: `[Keyword] <trigger/condition>, the system shall <expected behavior>`

### [Functional Requirement 1]

- [ ] **When** user clicks login button with valid credentials, the system shall authenticate and redirect to dashboard
- [ ] **If** credentials are invalid, **then** the system shall display error message "Invalid credentials"
- [ ] **While** user is logged in, the system shall maintain the session for configured timeout period

### [Functional Requirement 2]

- [ ] The system shall display data list with pagination of 10 items per page

## Existing Codebase Analysis

### Implementation Path Mapping
| Type | Path | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Existing | src/[actual-path] | [Current implementation] |
| New | src/[planned-path] | [Planned new creation] |

### Integration Points (Include even for new implementations)
- **Integration Target**: [What to connect with]
- **Invocation Method**: [How it will be invoked]

### Code Inspection Evidence

| File/Function | Relevance |
|---------------|-----------|
| [path:function] | [similar functionality / integration point / pattern reference] |

### Fact Disposition Table

One row per codebase analysis `focusAreas` entry. This table is the single binding between existing-behavior facts and the design — other sections that describe existing behavior reference the row by Focus Area name.

| Fact ID | Focus Area | Disposition | Rationale | Evidence |
|---------|------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| [fact_id from focusAreas] | [area name from focusAreas] | preserve / transform / remove / out-of-scope | [for transform: state new outcome; for remove: state reason; for out-of-scope: state which scope boundary excludes it; for preserve: brief confirmation] | [evidence value carried verbatim from focusAreas] |

### Main Components

Repeat the block below for each component.

#### Component 1

- **Responsibility**: [Scope of responsibility for this component]
- **Interface**: [APIs and contract definitions provided]
- **Dependencies**: [Relationships with other components]

### Data Representation Decision (When Introducing New Structures)

| Criterion | Assessment | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Semantic Fit | [Yes/No] | [Does existing structure's meaning align?] |
| Responsibility Fit | [Yes/No] | [Same bounded context?] |
| Lifecycle Fit | [Yes/No] | [Same creation/mutation/deletion timing?] |
| Boundary/Interop Cost | [Low/Medium/High] | [Cost of sharing across boundaries?] |

**Decision**: [reuse / extend / new] — [rationale in 1-2 sentences]

### Minimal Surface Alternatives (When Introducing Maintenance-Surface Elements)

One entry per new in-scope element. This section records the 5-step output produced by the invoking agent.

#### Element 1: [name of the new element — e.g., persistent state field, public-contract field, cross-boundary prop, behavioral mode/variant, reusable abstraction or component split]

**Step 1 — Fixed Requirements**
- [AC ID or constraint ID]: [requirement / constraint text]
- [AC ID or constraint ID]: [requirement / constraint text]

**Steps 2–3 — Alternatives Compared**

| Alternative | Current requirements covered (AC or constraint IDs) | New state introduced (count) | New concept / mode / flag (count) | Crosses component boundary (yes/no) | Breaking change or migration required (yes/no) | Subjective cost notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [The added element as proposed] | | | | | | |
| [Subtractive alternative — derive / compute on demand / keep at caller / reuse existing / do not introduce new state] | | | | | | |
| [Optional third alternative] | | | | | | |

**Step 4 — Selected Alternative and Rationale**
- **Selected**: [alternative name]
- **Rationale**:
  - If selected = smallest alternative considered: state "smallest alternative considered; no further reduction available"
  - If selected > smallest: name the current requirement(s) from step 1 that smaller alternatives fail to satisfy

**Step 5 — Rejected Alternatives Log**
- [Alternative name]: [1-2 lines on what it was and why rejected]
- [Alternative name]: [1-2 lines on what it was and why rejected]

(Repeat the Element block above for each additional in-scope element.)

Mark the whole section as N/A with brief rationale when the design introduces no in-scope elements.

### UI Error State Design (when feature includes frontend)

| Component / Screen | Loading | Empty | Error | Partial |
|-------------------|---------|-------|-------|---------|
| [Component name] | [Skeleton / spinner] | [Empty state + CTA] | [Error message + Retry] | [Cached display + Banner] |

### Client State Design (when feature includes frontend)

| State Category | State | Management Method | Sync Strategy |
|---------------|-------|-------------------|---------------|
| Server state | [Fetched data] | [Cache library / custom hook] | [Polling / WebSocket / manual refresh] |
| Local UI state | [Modal open, tab selection] | [useState / useReducer] | - |
| Temporary state | [Form input, draft] | [useState / form library] | [Auto-save / manual save] |

### UI Action - API Contract Mapping (when feature includes frontend)

| UI Action | API Endpoint | Request | Response | Error Contract |
|-----------|-------------|---------|----------|----------------|
| [Button click / form submit] | [POST /api/xxx] | [Request body fields] | [Response fields] | [Error codes and UI handling] |

### Error Handling

| Error Category | Example | Detection | Recovery Strategy | User Impact |
|---------------|---------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| [Validation / External / Infrastructure / Business logic] | [Specific error] | [How detected] | [Retry / Fallback / Propagate / Log-and-continue] | [User-facing message or silent handling] |

## Implementation Plan

### Implementation Approach

**Selected Approach**: [Approach name or combination]
**Selection Reason**: [Reason considering project constraints and technical dependencies]

### Technical Dependencies and Implementation Order

#### Required Implementation Order

Repeat the entry below for each component/feature, in dependency order.

1. **[Component/Feature]**
   - Technical Reason: [Why this needs to be implemented at this position]
   - Prerequisites / Dependent Elements: [Components depended on or that depend on this]

### Migration Strategy

[Technical migration approach, ensuring backward compatibility]

## Security Considerations

Evaluate the following for this feature's trust boundaries and data flow:

- **Authentication & Authorization**: What authentication is required for new entry points? What authorization checks protect resource access?
- **Input Validation**: Where does external input enter the system? How is it validated before processing?
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: What data requires protection (encryption, masking, access control)? What data is safe to include in logs and error responses?

Mark items as N/A with brief rationale when the feature has no relevant trust boundary.

## Test Boundaries

### Mock Boundary Decisions

| Component/Dependency | Mock? | Rationale |
|---------------------|-------|-----------|
| [External API / DB / File system / etc.] | [Yes/No] | [Why this boundary was chosen] |

### Data Layer Testing Strategy

- **Schema dependencies**: [List tables/models this feature reads from or writes to, with paths to their definitions]
- **Test data approach**: [How test data is provided — fixtures, factories, seed scripts, or real database]
- **Mock limitations acknowledged**: [What cannot be reliably tested with mocks alone for this feature]

Mark as N/A with brief rationale when the feature has no data layer dependencies.

### Integration Verification Points

- [List critical integration points that require testing beyond unit-level mocks]

## Verification Strategy

Verification Strategy defines what correctness means and how to prove it at design time. L1/L2/L3 levels (L1: functional operation works as end-user feature; L2: tests added and passing; L3: build succeeds without errors) define completion verification granularity at task execution time.

### Correctness Proof Method

How will this change's correctness be demonstrated?

- **Correctness definition**: [What "correct" means for this change — e.g., "output matches existing behavior", "all ACs pass in production-equivalent environment", "generated queries execute without error on target DB"]
- **Verification method**: [Specific technique — e.g., "compare new implementation output against existing implementation", "run against staging DB", "contract test with real API"]
- **Verification timing**: [When verification occurs — e.g., "after first vertical slice", "per repository", "at integration phase"]

### Early Verification Point

What is verified first, and how, to confirm the approach is correct before scaling?

- **First verification target**: [The smallest unit that proves the approach works — e.g., "first repository migration", "single API endpoint", "one screen flow"]
- **Success criteria**: [Observable outcome — e.g., "CSV download produces identical output to legacy", "API returns 200 with expected schema"]
- **Failure response**: [What to do if early verification fails — e.g., "reassess approach before proceeding", "escalate to user"]

### Output Comparison (When Replacing or Modifying Existing Behavior)

How will behavioral equivalence be verified between existing and new implementation?

- **Comparison input**: [Identical input used for both implementations — e.g., "same DB snapshot", "same API request payload"]
- **Expected output fields**: [Specific fields/columns to compare — e.g., "all output columns", "response body fields: id, status, amount"]
- **Diff method**: [How to compare — e.g., "file-level diff", "JSON field-by-field comparison", "row count + spot check"]
- **Transformation pipeline coverage**: [Each step from codebase analysis `dataTransformationPipelines` and what the comparison covers]

Mark as N/A with brief rationale when the design introduces entirely new behavior with no existing equivalent.

## Future Extensibility

This section records what was **excluded** from the current design surface. Speculative inclusions belong in a separate proposal.

- **Deferred possibilities**: [Capabilities considered during design and explicitly excluded from the current design surface. Each entry names either the current requirement it would have served, or marks itself as speculative]
- **Intentional limitations**: [What was deliberately kept small and why]
- **Extension points (existing, with current consumers)**: [Interfaces or hooks already in use by named current consumers. Each entry names a current consumer]

## Alternative Solutions

- **Disadvantages**: [Disadvantages]
- **Reason for Rejection**: [Why it wasn't adopted]
