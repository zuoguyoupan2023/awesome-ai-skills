## Verification Strategy (from Design Doc)

### Correctness Proof Method
- **Correctness definition**: [extracted from Design Doc]
- **Verification method**: [extracted from Design Doc]
- **Verification timing**: [extracted from Design Doc]

### Early Verification Point
- **First verification target**: [extracted from Design Doc]
- **Success criteria**: [extracted from Design Doc]
- **Failure response**: [extracted from Design Doc]

### Proof Strategy
- **Proof obligation source**: [test skeleton annotations (primary failure mode, proof obligation) when skeletons exist; otherwise each AC's primary failure mode]
- **Per-task propagation**: every task that implements a claim records Proof Obligations (see task template) so downstream review can judge whether the tests prove the claim, not merely run

## Quality Assurance Mechanisms (from Design Doc)

Adopted quality gates for the change area. Each task in this plan must satisfy these mechanisms.

| Mechanism | Enforces | Config Location | Covered Files |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| [Tool/check name] | [What quality aspect it enforces] | [path/to/config] | [file paths or patterns covered, or "project-wide"] |
| [Domain constraint] | [What it enforces] | [path/to/source] | [file paths or patterns covered, or "project-wide"] |

## Design-to-Plan Traceability

Maps each Design Doc technical requirement to the covering task(s). One row per extracted item. Every row must have at least one covering task, or an explicit gap justification.

| Design Doc | DD Section | DD Item | Category | Covered By Task(s) | Gap Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [docs/design/XXX.md — one of the Related Documents above] | [Section name from DD] | [Specific item] | impl-target / connection-switching / contract-change / verification / prerequisite | [Phase X Task Y] | covered | |

**Category values**: `impl-target` (implementation target), `connection-switching` (connection/switching/registration), `contract-change` (contract change and propagation), `verification` (verification requirement), `prerequisite` (prerequisite work)

**Gap Status values**: `covered` (task exists), `gap` (no task — requires justification in Notes, user confirmation required before plan approval)

## Failure Mode Checklist

Domain-independent failure categories this implementation must guard against. Enumerate all eight categories, mark which apply, and list a covering task for each that applies; keep entries free of project-specific names.

| Category | Applies? | Covered By Task(s) |
|---|---|---|
| same-value | yes/no | [Phase X Task Y] |
| no-op | yes/no | |
| empty input | yes/no | |
| invalid option | yes/no | |
| missing config | yes/no | |
| unavailable boundary | yes/no | |
| shared-state dependency | yes/no | |
| rollback-only visibility | yes/no | |

## UI Spec Component → Task Mapping

Include this section when a UI Spec is among the inputs. Maps each component documented in the UI Spec to the task(s) that implement it. Omit the section when no UI Spec exists.

| UI Spec Component (section heading) | States to Cover | Covered By Task(s) | Gap Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Use the UI Spec heading exactly as written, e.g., "§ Component: AlertCard"] | [default / loading / empty / error / partial — list the states the implementation must produce] | [Phase X Task Y] | covered | |

**Reference key rule**: The component identifier in column 1 is the UI Spec section heading (verbatim). UI Spec headings are unique by construction so this reference resolves to exactly one section.

**Gap Status values**: `covered` (task exists), `gap` (no task — requires justification in Notes, user confirmation required before plan approval)

## ADR Bindings

Include this section when ADRs are provided as input or listed in the Design Doc's "Prerequisite ADRs" section. Maps each implementation-binding ADR decision to the task(s) it constrains. Omit the section when no ADR applies.

A decision is **implementation-binding** when it constrains code placement, dependency direction, contract/schema shape, data flow, or persistence. Acceptance criteria and required behaviors are recorded in the Design Doc; this table covers only structural constraints from ADRs.

| ADR | Source Section | Axis | Binding Decision | Covered By Task(s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [docs/adr/ADR-XXXX.md] | Decision / Implementation Guidance | placement \| dependency_direction \| contract_schema \| data_flow \| persistence | [One implementation-binding decision sentence, copied or condensed from the named section] | [Phase X Task Y] |

One row per binding decision. A single ADR can contribute multiple rows. A single task can appear in multiple rows.

## Connection Map

Include this section when the implementation crosses more than one package, service, or process boundary. Document each boundary. Omit the section when the implementation stays within a single package.

| Boundary | Owner (left side) | Owner (right side) | Expected Signal | Covered By Task(s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [e.g., "web client → API gateway"] | [module/package on the request side] | [module/package on the response side] | [Observable evidence the boundary works — e.g., "HTTP 200 with response matching ContractA", "row inserted in tableB", "message published to topicC"] | [Phase X Task Y on each side] |

## Implementation Phases

Select ONE phase structure based on implementation approach from Design Doc. Phase Division Criteria are defined alongside this template. Per-phase quality checks run lint, typecheck, tests, build, and any adopted QA mechanisms from the Design Doc.

### Option A: Vertical Slice Phase Structure

Use when implementation approach is Vertical Slice. Each phase = one value unit with verification.

### Phase 1: [Value Unit 1 Name] (Estimated commits: X)
**Purpose**: [First vertical slice — proves approach works]
**Verification**: [From Verification Strategy: early verification point]

#### Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Implementation
- [ ] Task 2: Verification per Verification Strategy
- [ ] Quality check (staged)

#### Phase Completion Criteria
- [ ] Early verification point passed
- [ ] [Functional criteria]

### Phase 2: [Value Unit 2 Name] (Estimated commits: X)
**Purpose**: [Subsequent value unit]
**Verification**: [From Verification Strategy]

#### Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Implementation
- [ ] Task 2: Verification per Verification Strategy
- [ ] Quality check

#### Phase Completion Criteria
- [ ] [Functional criteria]
- [ ] [Quality criteria]

### Option B: Horizontal Slice Phase Structure

Use when implementation approach is Horizontal Slice. Phases follow Foundation → Core → Integration → QA.

### Phase 1: [Foundation] (Estimated commits: X)
**Purpose**: Contract definitions, interfaces, test preparation

#### Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Specific work content
- [ ] Task 2: Specific work content
- [ ] Quality check (staged)

### Option C: Hybrid Phase Structure

Use when implementation approach is Hybrid. Combine vertical and horizontal phases as defined in Design Doc implementation approach. Structure phases per Design Doc specification, ensuring each phase has Tasks, Verification, and Phase Completion Criteria sections matching the format above.

### Final Phase: Quality Assurance (Required) (Estimated commits: 1)

This phase is required for ALL implementation approaches.

**Purpose**: Cross-cutting quality assurance and Design Doc consistency verification
