# Task: [Task Name]

Metadata:
- Dependencies: task-01 → Deliverable: docs/plans/analysis/research-results.md
- Provides: docs/plans/analysis/api-spec.md (for research/design tasks)
- Size: Small (1-2 files)

## Implementation Content
[What this task will achieve]
*Reference dependency deliverables if applicable

## Target Files
- [ ] [Implementation file path]
- [ ] [Test file path]

## Investigation Targets
Files to read before starting implementation (file path, with optional search hint):
- [e.g., src/orders/checkout (processOrder function) — determined during task decomposition based on task nature]

## Binding Decisions
(Include this section when the work plan's ADR Bindings table covers this task. Omit otherwise.)

Each row is an ADR decision the implementation in this task must comply with.

| Source | Axis | Decision | Compliance Check |
|---|---|---|---|
| [docs/adr/ADR-XXXX.md (§ <Source Section>) — substitute the section name (`Decision` or `Implementation Guidance`) from the matching work plan row] | [Axis value copied verbatim from the work plan's ADR Bindings row] | [Binding decision copied from the work plan's ADR Bindings row] | [Y/N-answerable positive predicate that evaluates whether the planned/final implementation satisfies the decision] |

## Investigation Notes
(Implementation observations are appended here before implementation begins. When Binding Decisions exist, record the planned implementation approach and each Compliance Check result here.)

## Implementation Steps (TDD: Red-Green-Refactor)
### 1. Red Phase
- [ ] Read all Investigation Targets and record key observations
- [ ] Review dependency deliverables (if any)
- [ ] Verify/create contract definitions
- [ ] Write failing tests
- [ ] Run tests and confirm failure

### 2. Green Phase
- [ ] Add minimal implementation to pass tests
- [ ] Run only added tests and confirm they pass

### 3. Refactor Phase
- [ ] Improve code (maintain passing tests)
- [ ] Confirm added tests still pass

## Quality Assurance Mechanisms
(From work plan header — mechanisms relevant to this task's target files)
- [Tool/check name] — Enforces: [what] — Config: [path]

## Operation Verification Methods
(Derived from Verification Strategy in work plan)
- **Verification method**: [What to verify and how — e.g., "compare new implementation output against existing implementation at src/legacy/order_calc", "run endpoint against test database and verify response matches contract"]
- **Success criteria**: [Observable outcome that proves correctness — e.g., "output matches existing implementation for all input combinations", "API returns 200 with expected schema"]
- **Failure response**: [What to do if verification fails — e.g., "reassess approach before proceeding", "escalate to user"]
- **Verification level**: [L1: Functional operation as end-user feature / L2: New tests added and passing / L3: Code builds without errors]

## Proof Obligations
(One entry per AC or claim this task implements. Derived from test skeleton annotations when present, otherwise from the AC's primary failure mode. Each test must prove its claim, not merely run.)
- **Claim**: [the behavior the AC promises]
- **Primary failure mode**: [the regression the test turns red on]
- **Boundary to exercise**: [public/integration boundary the test traverses, or "in-process unit"]
- **State assertion**: [observable state before → action → after for state-changing claims; "N/A" otherwise]
- **Mock boundary rationale**: [which boundaries may be mocked and why; "none" when all real]
- **Residual**: [what this proof leaves unestablished, if any]

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] All added tests pass
- [ ] Operation verified per Operation Verification Methods above
- [ ] Each Proof Obligation is met: the test turns red under its primary failure mode and exercises the stated boundary
- [ ] Deliverables created (for research/design tasks)
- [ ] (When Binding Decisions exist) Every Compliance Check evaluates to `Y` against the final implementation, with evidence recorded in Investigation Notes (file:line, test result, or command output)

## Notes
- Impact scope: [Areas where changes may propagate]
- Scope boundary: [Files to preserve unchanged — path and reason]
