# Task Execution with Metacognitive Analysis

Task: $ARGUMENTS

## Mandatory Execution Process

**Step 1: Rule Selection via rule-advisor (REQUIRED)**

Invoke rule-advisor using Agent tool:
- `subagent_type`: "dev-workflows:rule-advisor"
- `description`: "Rule selection"
- `prompt`: "Task: $ARGUMENTS. Select appropriate rules and perform metacognitive analysis."

**Step 2: Utilize rule-advisor Output**

After receiving rule-advisor's JSON response, proceed with:

1. **Understand Task Essence** (from `taskAnalysis.essence`)
   - Focus on fundamental purpose, not surface-level work
   - Distinguish between "quick fix" vs "proper solution"

2. **Follow Selected Rules** (from `selectedRules`)
   - Review each selected rule section
   - Apply concrete procedures and guidelines

3. **Recognize Past Failures** (from `metaCognitiveGuidance.pastFailures`)
   - Apply countermeasures for known failure patterns
   - Use suggested alternative approaches

4. **Execute First Action** (from `metaCognitiveGuidance.firstStep`)
   - Start with recommended action
   - Use suggested tools first

**Step 3: Create Task List with TaskCreate**

Register work steps using TaskCreate. Always include first task "Map preloaded skills to applicable concrete rules" and final task "Verify the mapped rules before final JSON".

Break down the task based on rule-advisor's guidance:
- Reflect `taskAnalysis.essence` in task descriptions
- Apply `metaCognitiveGuidance.firstStep` to first task
- Restructure tasks considering `warningPatterns`
- Set priorities based on dependency order and warningPatterns severity

**Step 4: Execute Implementation**

Proceed with task execution following:
- Start with `metaCognitiveGuidance.firstStep` action from rule-advisor
- Update task structure with TaskUpdate to reflect rule-advisor insights
- Selected rules from rule-advisor
- Task structure (managed via TaskCreate/TaskUpdate)
- Quality standards defined in the selectedRules output from rule-advisor
- Monitor warningPatterns flags throughout execution and adjust approach when triggered
