description: Main entry-point skill for Transloadit. Route to the right `integrate-*`, `transform-*`, or `docs-*` skill, and prefer executing via `npx -y @transloadit/node ...` (CLI) for deterministic behavior.
---

# Quick Routing

1. Need reference (robot params/examples, no API calls): `docs-transloadit-robots`
2. Need a one-off transform (download outputs locally): `transform-*`
3. Need an end-to-end code integration (real app integration steps): `integrate-*`

Concrete entry points:
1. `docs-transloadit-robots`
2. `transform-generate-image-with-transloadit`
3. `transform-encode-hls-video-with-transloadit`
4. `transform-remove-background-with-transloadit`
5. `transform-describe-image-with-transloadit`
6. `transform-convert-markdown-to-pdf-with-transloadit`
7. `transform-transcribe-audio-with-transloadit`
8. `integrate-uppy-transloadit-s3-uploading-to-nextjs`
9. `integrate-asset-delivery-with-transloadit-smartcdn-in-nextjs`

## Install companion skills

If the skills above are not available in your environment, install all of them at once:

```bash
npx -y skills add https://github.com/transloadit/skills --all
```

Or install a single skill:

```bash
npx -y skills add https://github.com/transloadit/skills/tree/main/skills/<skill-name>
```

Replace `<skill-name>` with one of: `docs-transloadit-robots`,
`transform-generate-image-with-transloadit`, `transform-encode-hls-video-with-transloadit`,
`transform-remove-background-with-transloadit`, `transform-describe-image-with-transloadit`,
`transform-convert-markdown-to-pdf-with-transloadit`,
`transform-transcribe-audio-with-transloadit`,
`integrate-uppy-transloadit-s3-uploading-to-nextjs`,
`integrate-asset-delivery-with-transloadit-smartcdn-in-nextjs`.

# CLI Baseline (Recommended)

Most skills in this repo prefer using the `@transloadit/node` CLI via:

```bash
npx -y @transloadit/node ...
```

If a command errors with "Unsupported option name" or a missing subcommand, update to a newer `@transloadit/node`.

The CLI resolves auth in this order:
1. Shell environment variables
2. The current working directory `.env`
3. `~/.transloadit/credentials`

Prefer `~/.transloadit/credentials` as the default fallback for user-level or agent-level setup.
The file uses dotenv syntax and can include `TRANSLOADIT_KEY`,
`TRANSLOADIT_SECRET`, `TRANSLOADIT_ENDPOINT`, and `TRANSLOADIT_AUTH_TOKEN`.
The `.env` lookup is cwd-only and takes precedence over `~/.transloadit/credentials`. If your
`.env` lives in a parent directory, export the variables into the shell.

Builtin template discovery (token-efficient NDJSON):
```bash
npx -y @transloadit/node templates list --include-builtin exclusively-latest --fields id,name --json
```
