# KOL Pricing Logic Reference

This summarizes the deterministic logic in the app code so an agent can explain or preserve behavior while using the Skill.

- `src/lib/pricing.ts`
- `config/product.ts`
- `config/ideal-kols.ts`

## Data Inputs

The pricing report needs:
- Profile: username, display name, bio, follower count, following count, verified flags, protected flag, account creation date.
- Recent tweets: text, created date, likes, retweets, replies, quotes, impressions/views.
- Product config: name, pitch, desired action, URL, estimated LTV.
- Ideal KOL config: preferred tiers, excluded tiers, extra keywords, follower floor, engagement floor.

When using UnifAPI X/Twitter, use the current `/x/...` response shape. Map `profile.public_metrics.followers_count` to `followers_count`, `profile.public_metrics.following_count` to `following_count`, `profile.public_metrics.tweet_count` to `tweet_count`, `profile.protected` to `protected`, `profile.verified` or `profile.verified_type` to verification signals, and `tweet.public_metrics.impression_count` to impressions. Legacy flat fields such as `follower_count` and `view_count` are acceptable fallback inputs only.

## Tiers

The classifier chooses one primary tier:

| Tier | Meaning | Signals |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T | Trader | trading, perps, leverage, TA, DEX, PnL, prediction markets |
| N | NFT / Creator | NFT, collections, minting, art, drops, PFPs |
| B | Builder | developer, engineer, founder, OSS, GitHub, SDK, infra, smart contracts |
| I | Influencer / Research | research, alpha, thesis, macro, on-chain analysis, venture |
| M | Mass-reach | fallback when no tier-specific signal is found |

There is also a `+E` tool-builder overlay when the bio or tweets include signals such as GitHub, open source, dev tool, shipped, or shipping.

Extra keywords in `idealKOLs.extra_keywords` boost the first preferred tier.

## Engagement

Engagement is computed from recent tweets:

```text
avg_likes = total likes / tweet count
avg_retweets = total retweets / tweet count
avg_replies = total replies / tweet count
avg_impressions = total impressions / tweet count
engagement_rate = ((likes + retweets + replies) / tweet count / followers) * 100
```

If there are no tweets or no followers, engagement is zero.

## Warnings

Warnings are added when:
- The account is protected: danger, skip.
- Followers are below `idealKOLs.min_followers` and the account is not a tool builder.
- Account age is below 6 months and followers are below 5k.
- Engagement is below `idealKOLs.engagement_floor_pct`: danger.
- Engagement is above 8 percent: info, can pay 10-20 percent above base.
- The chosen tier is excluded by the ideal KOL config: danger, skip.

## Base Pricing Matrix

All cash values are USD.

### T: Trader

| Collab | Recommended | Cash | Term | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| oneshot | yes | 400-1000 | 1 tweet | Volume / on-chain product launch |
| activity | yes | 700-1500 | 2-6 weeks | Trading contest / PnL leaderboard. Top pick |
| ambassador | yes | 700-1800 | 3-6 mo | High-frequency content fits this tier |

### M: Mass-reach

| Collab | Recommended | Cash | Term | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| oneshot | yes | 2000-6000 | 1 tweet | Brand-reach play. Pin 24h |
| activity | no | 0 | none | Top-tier KOLs do not actually sign up and play |
| ambassador | no | 0 | none | ROI is dreadful at this price |
| affiliate | no | 0 | none | Top influencers do not accept rev share |
| launch | yes | 3000-8000 | 7-14 days | Major launch volume anchor |

## Price Adjustments

Two multipliers are applied to non-zero rows:

```text
tool_builder_boost = 1.20 if classification.is_tool_builder else 1.0
engagement_boost = 0.70 if engagement_rate < 0.5 else 1.0
adjusted_cash = round(base_cash * tool_builder_boost * engagement_boost)
```

If any danger warning exists and the tier is not `M`, recommendations marked `yes` are downgraded to `maybe`.

## Top Pick

The framework skips if:
- the chosen tier is excluded, or
- the tier is not `M` and engagement is below 0.1 percent.

Otherwise the default top picks are:

| Tier | Default top pick |
| --- | --- |
| T | activity |
| N | oneshot |
| B | ambassador |
| I | oneshot |
| M | oneshot |

If the default row is not available, choose the first `yes` row. If none exists, skip.

## ROI

Conversion assumptions:

| Tier | Impression rate | Effective view rate | Registration rate | Subscription rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T | 0.06 | 0.30 | 0.20 | 0.10 |
| N | 0.05 | 0.28 | 0.10 | 0.08 |
| B | 0.07 | 0.30 | 0.15 | 0.12 |
| I | 0.06 | 0.30 | 0.12 | 0.10 |
| M | 0.08 | 0.30 | 0.05 | 0.08 |

Touch points:

| Collab | Touch points |
| --- | --- |
| oneshot | 1 |
| activity | 6 |
| ambassador | 5 |
| affiliate | 2.5 |
| launch | 4 |

Formula:

```text
effective_impressions = touch_points * followers * impression_rate * effective_view_rate
if engagement_rate < 0.5: effective_impressions *= 0.3

registrations = effective_impressions * registration_rate
subscriptions = registrations * subscription_rate
ltv_revenue = subscriptions * product.ltv_usd
roi_multiplier = (ltv_revenue - avg_cash_cost) / avg_cash_cost
```

When cash cost is zero, ROI multiplier is reported as 0.

## Outreach Boundary

The original app uses an LLM only for DM copy. The Skill should keep analysis deterministic and let the calling agent draft the DM from:
- profile summary,
- tier and top pick,
- offer,
- product config,
- one specific recent tweet.

Core DM constraints:
- 60-110 words.
- No hype, no emojis, no exclamation marks.
- Reference exactly one recent tweet when possible.
- End with a low-friction ask.
